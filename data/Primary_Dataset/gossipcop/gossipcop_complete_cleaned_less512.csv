According to insiders, there are no limits to what DeGeneres will do to make sure she stays married to de Rossi.

After four years of dating, in the summer of 2008, the funny television personality and the Australian actress were married at their home in Beverly Hills, California.

The ceremony was attended by the biggest names in Hollywood and by their four dogs and three cats.

The honeymoon did not last very long, head spinning scandals have plagued DeGeneres and de Rossi’s relationship.

Some rumors claimed that de Rossi was jealous of her wife’s fame and wealth.

Other allegations that hounded the power couple included fights over children and de Rossi dreamed of motherhood while DeGeneres was not interested.

Despite the rumors, the pair is determined to stick together like glue and have been going through therapy to make it work.

The host of “Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “The Night We Called It a Day” star are also going on date nights to reconnect and discover why they fell in love in the first place.

According to a spy with links to the “Coneheads” star: “After eight years of marriage, Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi are dating again. The two are going on the therapist-recommended date nights as part of a last-ditch effort to save their troubled union.”

The insider elaborated: “Part of their therapy is to go on more date nights. That’s why they’ve been seen out and about more together lately.”

The very pricey therapy sessions have led to the following conclusion, for a relationship to work the two parties should know when to take part in the same activities and when to give each other breathing room.

The spy shared: “It’s all about spending quality time together, but still giving each other space during the workday.”

Kim Kardashian just wants her sisters to be happy and healthy, which is why she’s wishing for the end of Khloé’s relationship with her cheating boyfriend and baby daddy, Tristan Thompson. According to the Hollywood Life, Kim is “counting down the days” until Khloé and baby True get the hell out of Cleveland and return home to Calabasas.

Ever since news broke that Tristan had cheated on Khloé, just days before she gave birth to their daughter, reports about Khloé’s well-being have been contradictory: Does she feel like she’s “living in hell?” Is she trying to make things work? Is she lying about everything?

One person who has been explicit and steadfast in her sentiments is her sister Kim, who last month called the whole scenario “fucked up.” And, according to a source close to the Kardashians who spoke to Hollywood Life, Kim’s feelings haven’t changed.

“Kim is counting down the days ’til Khloe gets her shit together and kicks Tristan to the curb,” the source said. “It’s driving Kim insane that Khloe is still with Tristan because she deserves so much more. But Kim knows that she can’t tell Khloe what to do — she has to make that decision alone.”

The source also revealed that Kim has been trying to convince Khloé to go to “intensive therapy” to help her with her “chronically low self-esteem.”

The source continued, “Until she fixes that issue, she’s going to continue to fall in love with men that aren’t emotionally available and giving.”

She has a pizza oven. Like, we’ve made pizzas at her house. She’s very cool and very sweet.

Selena Gomez and Mandy Teefey have some issues to work out in their mother/daughter relationship, and their recent feud all began when the 25-year-old reconciled with on-off love, Justin Bieber. Now, it’s in Justin’s court to prove to Mandy that he’s a changed man from all those times he broke Selena’s heart…and his plan to do so is already underway! The Biebs is currently on vacation with his own mom, Patti Mallette, which he hopes will “demonstrate to Mandy how important family is to him,” HollywoodLife has EXCLUSIVELY learned.

Justin and Patti have drifted apart in their own right over the years, but are bonding in “paradise” on their trip. “It serves as a display of what he’s hoping Selena can achieve with her mother someday,” our inside says. “He feels terrible for Selena that her mother won’t accept him, and sympathizes with her and what she’s dealing with. Justin wants to show Mandy that he has matured immensely, and that he can be to Selena what she is to him — his rock and support. Justin truly hopes Selena and Mandy can form a great bond just like he now has with his own mom.”

Selena hasn’t commented on the ongoing drama she’s having with her mom. Meanwhile, it’s been quite a bit of time since we’ve actually seen Justin and Selena together.

After that, though, they went their separate ways — she spent time in Texas and New York, while he took a ski trip, spent a few days in Dubai, and then headed to the Maldives with Patti.

The Oscar-winning actor has been reportedly spending a lot of time with renowned architect Neri Oxman, and word has it Jennifer Aniston, 49, is NOT happy about it. “Jen is crushed after hearing the rumors that Brad has been talking to a beautiful, Angelina Jolie lookalike, MIT professor. Jen had her hopes up of a possible reconciliation with Brad since she and her ex started talking again. When they both became recently single, Jen thought the timing couldn’t be better, and she might have her fairytale, happy ending with Brad after all. Jen never stopped loving him,” a source close to Jen tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.

As we previously told you, Jennifer and Brad started speaking following her separation from her husband Justin Theroux, 46. A source explained to Star magazine that Jen and Brad “have been secretly getting together for late-night hookups, and it’s all because of George [Clooney].” So, you can understand why she’s so taken aback by the news! And TBH, so are we. We were SO here for a Brad and Jennifer reunion. Even Brad’s mom Jane Pitt was hoping the two would rekindle things. “Brad’s mom Jane has always had a soft spot for Jennifer, even after their divorce they kept in touch for years,” a source explained to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Aww!

However, before we lose hope completely, Page Six claims things between Brad and Neri are strictly friendly. “This is best described as a professional friendship,” a source told the outlet. Phew! There’s hope after all. Nevertheless, we certainly wouldn’t mind seeing Brad and Jen together again. But most importantly, we want them to be happy.",fake

An explosive report from Life & Style states that their two and a half year marriage was ‘dysfunctional from the get-go’ and ‘never a real marriage.’

He believes he is the man for her and intends to pursue her when he gets out of prison,” Halperin continued. “There is definitely a long history there.” But the report claims that is O.J. is unable to date Kris, he wants to date Caitlyn Jenner! “O.J. is obsessed with Caitlyn,” he claims. “He is struck by how she has captured the hearts of the world and said with a straight face, ‘When I get out of here I would consider dating her too’.”

Head here for tons more photos of Sel and Justin together!

The signature pout that helped the reality star launch her beauty empire Kylie Cosmetics—featuring the highly-coveted Kylie Lip Kits—is no longer, according to a photo the beauty mogul posted to her Instagram on Sunday.

""[S]he looks like the old Kylie here and idk why,"" one fan commented under the picture of Jenner and her best friend Anastasia Karanikolaou, to which Kylie responded, ""i got rid of all my filler,"" adding two shocked emojis and a smiling face emoji. Another fan praised Jenner for embracing an all natural look, writing, ""YESSS KYLIE!!! you look stunning w more natural looking lips. i stan this we STAN,"" with Kylie replying to the fan with a few heart face emojis.

Jenner confirmed that her pumped up pout (which inspired the #KylieJennerChallenge, in which fans would use small cups to plump their lips) was a result of lip injections during an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians in 2015.

A year later in an interview with Complex, Jenner admitted that she may have gone too far with the lip injections. ""When you first get them done, you’re like, ‘Oh, it could be a little bit bigger on that side.’ I’d go back and be like, ‘They went down’ and think they could be bigger. But I went too far. It was very painful,"" she explained. ""It’s annoying to hear every day that you’re just this fake, plastic person when you’re not.”

When she’s not nauseous, though, she’s having weird cravings, and she can’t stop eating ice cream!” That certainly does seem a little fishy.

Selena also isn’t concerned about having kids at a relatively young age, as insiders claim to the mag: “Her own mom [Mandy Teefey] had her at 16, and Selena thinks her mom did a great job, so being a young mom has never been an issue.”

This is a lot to take in, and of course we’re wondering if Selena is nervous about these dramatic changes in her life. Well, yes and no! “She is excited,” a source shares with Life & Style. “She has always talked about having a little girl.”

On last Sunday’s BET awards, it was quite clear that Jay-Z and Beyonce were not buddy, buddy with Kim Kardashian. In fact, the camera caught Jay barely acknowledge Kim when he was going on stage to accept his award with Kanye West. Since Jay and Kanye are not only music collaborators but close friends, will “Kimye” stand a chance?

Unfortunately, Kim cannot make Kanye’s friends like her. It will be Kanye’s responsibility to lay the law down with his buddies. He must let it be known that high school bully behavior toward his girlfriend is unacceptable.

If his friends continue to snub her, then the rap star will have to distance himself from his friends until they realize he and Kim are a package deal.

Although Jay-Z and Beyonce have preconceived notions of what Kim and the Kardashians are all about, they do not actually know who Kim is.

If they take off their judgmental glasses, they may even come to like her or at least tolerate her in their group.

Remember, if a friend is happy with their new significant other, don’t hate. There is a strong chance a friend will be lost.

Move over, reality TV! HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned that Kendall Jenner is ready to stop spending her time on ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ and instead, focus on being a full-time model.

Despite being one of the most popular reality TV stars of this generation, Kendall Jenner, 21, has decided it’s time to move away from the small screen and walk on more runways. “Don’t expect to see Kendall starring in her own reality show anytime soon. Of course she’s really pleased for [sister] Kylie [Jenner], but Kendall wants to move away from that scene, and be taken seriously as a top model, and not as a reality star. Kendall will still make some appearances here and there in [KUWTK], and in Kylie’s new show, but only when she’s in town and around — she wants to limit her time on camera as much as possible,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

With Kendall’s recent eye-catching moments in Cannes, it’s no surprise that she wants to flaunt what she’s got and make it her career goal. “Kendall’s modeling career is going really amazing, and she’s worked so hard to be taken seriously. She feels like she’s finally getting there and that she’s now being booked because she’s Kendall the model, not just one of the Kardashians. Kendall is grateful for the start in her career that the show gave her, it was a great springboard for her, but at the same time, it was a hiderence—and it’s not the thing that she wants to be known for in her life. She wants to be known in her own right as a supermodel, to beat her own drum, and to make her own millions, away from the Kardashian family brand name,” our insider adds.

In addition to modeling, Kendall has been busy with many other endeavors. The brunette beauty just launched her newest clothing line with Kylie and was recently spotted having some fun with rumored rapper beau, A$AP Rocky, 28, in Cannes.

This is completely fake news. The false rumors say that the model is worried about the Kardashian-Jenner clan driving the NBA star away, but there is no truth to any of this.

Gossip Cop was the one that found out where things really stand between the two.

Kendall and Blake haven’t even confirmed yet that they are dating, but the pair was indeed spotted together on various outings in the past few weeks.

On Ok!’s website there was an article posted where she says that she is worried about her family interfering in her love life and as a result, she advised Blake to stay away from her sisters and mom.

A so-called source tells the magazine, ‘He’s been invited over to Kris’s for dinner numerous times, but Kendall’s told him to ignore the invites and keep away.’

The outlet’s dubious insider goes on to say Griffin isn’t totally comfortable shunning the Kardashians because he’s ‘worried he’s being rude, but ultimately he trusts Kendall’s judgment because the last thing he wants is to be cursed like Caitlyn [Jenner], Lamar Odom and so many others.’

But a new report from Us Weekly has it that the timeline for baby #1 has become accelerated after the royal wedding. Multiple sources have told the outlet that after the ceremony, the two's desire for having kids grew. “Having children is definitely a priority,” a source close to Markle told Us. “She and Harry want to start a family right away—and she’ll start trying as soon as she can.”

A second source that the outlet describes as a royal insider echoed this, though was a little less ""this'll happen ASAP."" “They both can’t wait to start a family. [Still,] Harry and Meghan won’t rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They’ll make fantastic parents.”

A third source chimed in that even Markle's mom Doria Ragland believes that baby will come soon. “Doria is expecting to be a grandmother by this time next year. She’s very excited for Meghan to become a mother.”

Harry and Markle are currently believed to be on their honeymoon, though they are expected to attend the Queen's Trooping of the Colour official birthday parade this Saturday. They have a trip planned to Australia this fall for the Sydney Invictus Games and are said to have a busy second half of the year coming with work engagements.

Heck yes! Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are the hottest couple around these days and they could be taking the romance to the pages of ‘Vogue.’ HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVE details on how the singers are up for a sexy and stylish fashion spread together.

We completely lost it over the heat that Gigi Hadid, 21, and Zayn Malik, 24 brought to the pages of Vogue, and now our favorite new celebrity couple Selena Gomez, 24, and The Weeknd, 27, could be next in line to show off their love while looking oh so fashionable. “Selena and Anna Wintour discussed a possible photo shoot with The Weeknd. Anna loves the idea. Celebrity couples always do well for Vogue and needless to say Selena and The Weeknd are today’s top trendsetters and Hollywood’s hottest couple,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

Selly had Anna’s ear during the Coach show at NYFW, where they were seated together in the front row Feb. 14. The singer is the new face of the clothing and accessories brand, and we’re sure she’d love to wear their designs in the magazine alongside her stylish boyfriend. Of course they would want the shoot to be as glamorous as possible and our inside says that, “Paris and Greece were named as potential location shoots.”

Gigi and Zayn’s insanely hot Vogue spread will be hard to top, as the two stunners were photographed with romantic Naples, Italy as their backdrop. Who can forget that epic kiss she gave him while doing a yoga handstand above his body? Those two followed in the footsteps Kanye West, 39, and Kim Kardashian‘s 2014 cover spread that the 36-year-old reality star had been coveting for years. Selena has never landed an American Vogue cover after appearing on international editions including Brazil and Australia, so it would be perfect timing for her to get one and show off her sexy romance with The Weeknd.

HollywoodLifers, do you think it’s finally time that Selena gets her own American Vogue cover?

Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.“They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”“He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.Have something to add to the story?

A new report claiming the “Fury” actor has been leaning on his girlfriend to help him stay clean amid his struggle with alcohol abuse is false.

A source close to the actor told Gossip Cop Oxman isn’t involved in that aspect of his life. The RadarOnline article alleges the MIT professor “has been a great influence” on the actor and is “extremely supportive” of his sobriety.

“She is about as straight-laced as they come… Neri is a firm believer that people should not put anything into their bodies that does not belong,” a “source” told the site.

Pitt first admitted he gave up alcohol during a 2017 interview with GQ. The actor revealed he was an avid drinker and smoker for more than half his life but was motivated to stop following his divorce.

“I mean I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family. But even this last year, you know—things I wasn't dealing with. I was boozing too much. It’s just become a problem. And I'm really happy it’s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I’ve got my feelings in my fingertips again,” he told the publication.

While the false report alleges Oxman has been a key factor in keeping Pitt from falling off the wagon, Gossip Cop noted another publication had already reported that the actor had actually already worked out a strategy to maintain his sobriety.

“He goes to therapy every week and is mostly interested in learning and bettering himself as a man and father,” a source told Us Weekly in January.

Pitt continues to remain committed to the six children--Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9-- he shares with Jolie. The actor is reportedly expected to spend his summer in Los Angeles to be closer to them as he and the actress hammer out a divorce settlement.

Fans noticed the headlines parody real tabloid stories about the star.

Her second cover, with the headline, ""Why She Disappeared,"" seems to mimic an Us Weekly issue with the same title.

As Buzzfeed points out, Swift even got the logos down. Her ""TS Swiftly"" emblem looks like Us Weekly's, while her ""TS!!"" one resembles OK!'s.



The cover art for Swift's new album, filled with faux headlines and newspaper clippings, also references the theme of clapping back at critics and other real-life celebrity frenemies. While some praise the singer for ""taking back the narrative,"" others disapprove of her attack on the media, which one Cosmo article notes is reflective of Trump's relationship with the press.

“When you’re in a room with him, it’s not like you’re always aware of where he is,” Rogen explained. “We honestly tried to make him — for lack of a better word — adorable.”

Colbert did not ask Rogen about the crippling Sony hacks which have plagued the backing studio in recent weeks, which have lead to leaks of private information and threat against the families of Sony employees. But he did imply Rogen’s own safety could be in jeopardy.

-3582461668,Carrie Underwood Forced Mike Fisher To Retire For Second Baby?,"Did Carrie Underwood force Mike Fisher to retire so they can have a second baby? That’s the claim in this week’s tabloids. Gossip Cop, however, can reveal what’s really going on.

“Carrie Underwood: Baby #2 To Save Marriage,” reads a headline in the new issue of Star, which contends, “The country superstar pushed hubby Mike Fisher to quit pro hockey so they could work on their troubled relationship and having another child together.” After Fisher announced his retirement earlier this month, the tabloid is now claiming Underwood “made sure Mike understood it was the right time” to call it quits on his playing days.

A so-called “source” is quoted as saying, “Carrie told Mike in no uncertain terms to hang up his skates, in a dramatic attempt to get more together time to mend their troubled relationship.” But the gossip magazine’s supposed snitch doesn’t seem to have first-hand knowledge to back that assertion up. “I heard that she had become really unhappy with the situation. Having Mike home will be one solution, and I believe she hopes that having another baby together will bring them even closer than when they first fell in love,” the purported tipster is quoted as saying.",fake

It looks like Tyga’s days on Kanye West’s record label may be numbered, as HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned Kim Kardashian is pressuring her husband to drop Tyga now that he and Kylie Jenner are no longer dating.

Kylie Jenner, 19, and Tyga‘s breakup is causing a major rift in the family. Scott Disick is “Team Tyga” all the way and doesn’t want to stop being friends with him. In fact, he wants to make sure Kanye West, 39, keeps Tyga, 27, on his record label so the rapper can sustain a good income. However, Kim Kardashian is “Team Kylie” and pressuring her husband to drop Tyga fast.

“Kim is pressuring her husband to move on from Tyga. Kim always had questions about Kylie’s relationship with Tyga and wishes Kanye would follow Kylie’s lead and separate ties with the struggling rapper. Kim feels like Kanye has enough stress in his life and managing her sister’s ex is something Kanye doesn’t need in his life,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

Obviously, Kanye is the head of his record label so the final decision rests with him, but if we were Tyga, we’d be worried. “His loyalty is going to be with Kylie and the family over Tyga,” another source told us. And we hear that if Kylie were to ask him to drop Tyga from his label, he’d do so in a heartbeat. “If Kylie wanted to be petty, she could probably get Kanye to drop Tyga from his label. I’m not saying she’s going to do that, I don’t think she’s that bitter. But if it came down to it and that’s what the family wanted, I’m sure Kanye wouldn’t even question it,” the source added.

From their club night PDA in Miami, to their recent paparazzi stunt in NYC, it’s safe to say they’re back together. “Justin is in a good place with Hailey, she makes him feel good, secure, and she is always caring to him,” a source close to JB tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. The insider is definitely right about that. On June 11, Hailey was spotted wiping the “What Do You Mean” singer down with a towel after he took a swim. So cute, right? “He feels happy and proud to be with her, and he doesn’t mind flaunting their rekindled romance around town,” our source continued.

However, Hailey’s affection isn’t the only reason Justin’s been so open about their relationship. Word has it, Justin is also trying to get the attention of a certain someone. “He does miss Selena [Gomez], and if they can’t be together, he has no problem with her seeing that he is moving on with someone else who has always been there for him,” the source added. For those of you who don’t know, Selena and Justin decided to call it quits back in March after giving their relationship a fourth try. So, the wound is still pretty fresh.

And to Justin’s relief, seeing him with Hailey has been hard for Sel. “Selena is aware that Justin and Hailey have been hanging out again, and of course, it stings. She still has very deep feelings for Justin, despite everything that’s happened there’s a lot of love there. It’s painful for her to see that he’s with Hailey again, but it is what is,” another source explained to HL. It looks like Selena and Justin will be keeping tabs on each other’s lives forever!",fake

Laura Dern won an Emmy for her performance in ""Big Little Lies.""

As she went up to the stage, the camera showed her hugging co-stars Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley — but not Reese Witherspoon.

People are freaking out about the apparent snub.

A closer look at the circumstances shows that Dern and Witherspoon are probably chill.

Laura Dern won an Emmy Sunday night for her supporting role in HBO's ""Big Little Lies."" And while she thanked her co-stars (many of them nominees as well) in her speech, she may have snubbed one of them on her way to the stage.

In the CBS broadcast of her winning the award, it shows Dern hugging co-stars Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley (who she beat in the category of supporting actress in a limited TV series or movie), but skipping over Reese Witherspoon, who also starred in ""Big Little Lies.""

People are freaking out over the apparent snub.

A more likely solution is that the aired footage simply didn't show the hug between Witherspoon and Dern. At the beginning of the shot where Dern hugs her co-stars, it looks like she's pulling away from Witherspoon, as if they had just embraced.

It's also possible that Dern was just gripping the seat in front of her as she was getting up. It's not totally clear.

Dern also, after all, did give a shoutout to Witherspoon in her speech. ""I share this with my tribe of four ladies,"" she said, referring to her co-stars Witherspoon, Kidman, Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz. So there probably isn't any beef between them.

Also, it's just kind of awkward to hug someone in the seat in front of you. The chair is in the way. What's she supposed to do? Like, hug the back of her neck? Tap her on the shoulder? Everyone watching is waiting for her to come onstage.

Before Kelly spoke about her personal experience with Lauer, she read the official statement from the network and showed the comments from Lauer’s former co-host Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, who was hosting in place of Lauer on Wednesday.

“This one does hit close to home,” Kelly said, referring to Lauer’s firing. “I too have known Matt for a long time, and he has been a friend, and kind and supportive to me in my transition to NBC News and I see the anguish on my colleague’s faces.”

“But when this happens,” Kelly continued, “What we don’t see is the pain on the faces of the women who found the courage to come forward. And it is a terrifying thing to do. We don’t see the career opportunities women lose because of sexual harassment or the intense stress it causes a woman dealing with it when she comes to work each day. I am thinking of those women this morning and hoping they are okay. The days to come will not be easy.”

NBC News announced Wednesday morning that Lauer, who had anchored the Today Show for more than two decades, had been fired following accusations of sexual misconduct. “While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he’s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident,” NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said in a statement.

“Seeing Jennifer happy again with someone else has made him realize that he wants her back. Ben’s been reaching out to her in hopes that they can reconnect,” says an insider, adding “he’s been trying to convince Jennifer that Alex is trouble.”

While our source explains that this may have been something the Shades of Blue star wanted at one point, “she can’t help but be wary of his intentions. He always wants what he

can’t have.”

“She genuinely cares for Alex and she’s happy,” the source continues. “Alex has told Jennifer that he sees a future with her. She loves him and thinks she might be ready to go down that path.”

A so-called insider snitched to The Sun that Victoria, 43, is reportedly not a fan of David’s friend Lady Mary Charteris.

Read more: Duchess of Cambridge shows off her blossoming baby bump

Why, you ask? Well the source alleged it’s all because Lady Mary loves a good party and Victoria worries about that rubbing off on David, 42.

The insider said: “David has spent time partying with Mary at events into the early hours of the morning.”

Apparently David was introduced to Lady Mary through his good friend Dave Gardner, who is engaged to Hollywood actress Liv Tyler.

“Victoria is very worried that she is not the best influence on David,” continued the insider.

“They met at Glastonbury but Victoria is not fond of her.”

Oh dear. Of course, this is all just wild rumours and until Posh, Becks or Mary actually respond, we’ll take it with a pinch of salt!

And hey, even if Lady Mary does like a party, so what?

We all have that friend who loves a good night out and is buckets of fun to be around!

Lady Mary, 30, is rather well-connected (perhaps obvious given the whole title…)

She’s the daughter of Scottish nobleman James Charteris, the 13th Earl of Wemyss and 9th Earl of March and has Jerry Hall as her godmother.

The model and socialite has been married to rocker Robbie Furze since 2012.

Scott can’t stand that Kourt is flaunting PDA online, so he is going to do something about it,” a source close to Scott tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Uh-oh!

He said: “He was high-fiving the receptionist and saying, ‘You’re the best receptionist ever.’ High-fiving the phone person and saying, ‘You’d better answer those phones!’ which I thought was a tad patronising.

“Coming into an office and saying, ‘Wow, you answer phones!’ It seemed a bit self-aware, like, ‘I’m really famous and you’re really excited that I’ve acknowledged you.’”

-344385140,Yolanda Hadid Addresses Gigi Hadid Pregnancy Rumors,"Another day, another celebrity rumor to debunk.

The Twittersphere was having a field day this week after word started spreading that Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik were supposedly having a baby. Yep, you read that right. The whole thing got started when an Instagram comment allegedly written by Gigi's mother, Yolanda Hadid, began making the rounds on social media. The comment in question said: ""I will be a proud grandma in eight months. Life is a blessing.""

As it turns out, it seems like that comment might have been the work of Photoshop, since the real Yolanda Hadid took to Twitter last night to clear everything up — and she made a pretty good point in the process. ""No of course not,"" Yolanda wrote in response to a fan who asked if the rumor was true. ""If my daughter was pregnant, she would be the one to announce it not me,"" she added. We want to give her a high five for that explanation because she's 100% right — in a hypothetical scenario where Gigi is pregnant, it would be her news to share, not anyone else's.

Nevertheless, this hasn't stopped fans from speculating on Twitter and discussing the rumor at length. But this situation is a good reminder that we shouldn't believe everything we see on the Internet, even if it seems like a legit screenshot from social media. Images can be altered, and sometimes Photoshop is very convincing. Ultimately, we need to listen to the stars themselves, and in this case, it seems like Yolanda made herself pretty clear. Perhaps we can put this particular rumor to rest now; after all, there's sure to be another one tomorrow.

Do you think that’s just her natural reticence or is she actually shame-dating Seth and she doesn’t want people to know? My general thought on Charlize is that she would never shame-date someone. If Charlize is going to take the trouble to bang you, she doesn’t mind if people know. More likely she’s hiding her face because she just didn’t want to be photographed at that moment or whatever.

Of course, there's still the minor obstacle of the fact that Ben is technically still married to Jennifer Garner, but it seems Affleck and Shookus won't allow that pesky little detail to stand in their way.

According to Radar Online, Ben and Lindsay are currently in the process of planning a Hawaiian wedding.

“They want to do it before the end of summer when Lindsay goes back to work on SNL,” an insider tells the site.

“They love Hawaii and had a great time there in April when Ben was filming Triple Frontier.”

Is it just us, or does a Ben Affleck movie set in Hawaii with the title of Triple Frontier sound like something from an SNL sketch?

But we digress.

“Ben’s talking luau, leis and Hawaiian shirts,” the source adds.

“He’s already asked Jen to watch the kids while he’s away,"" says the insider.

Wow, if that's not the ultimate act of passive aggression.

Hey, Jen do you think you could watch the kids during the one weekend I'm supposed to have them this summer? Lindsay and I have plans. I already bought the rings and everything.

Anyway, the most interesting part of all this is the fact that Ben and Lindsay are reportedly expecting a child together.

“People suspect the sense of urgency is because Lindsay’s pregnant,” the informant claims.

“And nothing hides a bump better than a muumuu dress.”

Well, if the speculation is based on nothing other than the fact that these two seem to be in a hurry and some traditional Hawaiian attire is baggy, then we're gonna have to go ahead and call BS.

But who knows?

Maybe Lindsay really is pregnant with Ben's baby, as the tabloids have been claiming for most of the past year.

If so, our sincere congrats go out to a couple that most folks didn't give much of a chance to.

Just keep Ben away from those mai-tais at the wedding!",fake
-3401078624,Jennifer Aniston is pregnant at 48 – US report,"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are expecting their first child after 16 months of fertility treatments, according to a bombshell report published in US magazine Star today.

“Obviously, this is an absolute dream come true for Jen,” Star’s source reveals. “In fact, it’s nothing short of a miracle. Jen just turned 48 this month, and she and Justin both knew that at her age, the odds were against her getting pregnant. It’s such a blessing.”

The couple struggled to get pregnant on their own before trying IVF, claims the publication’s insiders.

“Jen and Justin had talked about having kids from day one, and at first they tried to do it naturally,” the source says. “They were crushed when it became clear that she couldn’t get pregnant on her own, so they went to a fertility specialist.”

After several rounds of IVF, they finally got the good news in December, according to Star.

“They’ve been through so much heartache along the way, but now it seems their baby dreams have finally come true,” adds the source.

Taylor Swift is gearing up to kick off her world tour in May, with Camila Cabello and Charli XCX in support.

But, while fans are leaping up and down with excitement, one person reportedly isn’t too thrilled about the trio heading out on the road – Selena Gomez.

According to reports, the Come And Get It singer is ‘happy’ for her fellow popstars, but is envious at the fun they are going to have without her.

‘Selena is so happy for Camila and Taylor, she love them both and knows they’re going to have the best time on tour together,’ an insider reportedly told HollywoodLife.

‘But there’s a part of her that’s envious too.

‘Taylor’s her best friend and she can’t help but wish she was going on tour with her.

‘But more than anything Selena is just happy for Camilla, she knows how much this means to her, it’s so huge.’

Selena has had a tough few months, after she revealed she had undergone a kidney transplant for her battle with Lupus.

And the procedure took its toll on the 25-year-old, who ‘went through a depression’ during the process.

In a chat with Self Magazine Francia Raisa – who donated the kidney to Selena – confessed they both struggled with their mental health throughout the journey.

She said: ‘[I was told], “It’s going to be hard, the recipient is going to glow and she’s going to recover a lot faster than the donor because she’s getting something she needs and you are losing something you don’t need to lose. It’s going to be hard.” And it was very hard.

The country star began celebrating his special day early over the weekend, with Gwen sharing Instagram photos and videos of the couple hanging out with her relatives, who hail from Los Angeles, before heading back to his native Oklahoma.

Gwen posted video clips of herself, Blake, and her kids taking a helicopter ride to his property by the lake, where she teased him to see if he noticed the new addition to the landscape.

""What do you see? Do you see anything different?"" she asked, as Blake caught sight of the towering pole, with the U.S. flag raised high.

The pop star then uploaded a clip of Blake standing beneath the pole with his cap held over his heart, as she giggled in the background.

""Blake's (birthday) day present from, me!! #flag #pole,"" she captioned a shot of her patriotic man.

Shelton also received a huge cake moulded into the shape of a vodka bottle from his own Smithworks brand.

Opening the cooler to reveal the sweet treat, he exclaimed, ""What in the world is that? Wow, look at that!""

""Thank you Smithworks family, it's the greatest birthday cake ever!,"" he added in another video, before taking a bite right out of the neck of the edible bottle.

The group went on to enjoy some time frolicking on Blake's boat, before capping off the night with a big meal at home, hosted by Gwen.

""B day dinner for my boo (sic),"" she wrote as she showed off the table setting.

The couple has been splitting its time between Gwen's home in Los Angeles and Blake's pad in Oklahoma ever since the stars started dating in the summer of 2015, following the breakdown of their respective marriages.

-3335184635,Jennifer Aniston Didn’t Spend $100K On Makeover Months After Justin Theroux Split,"Jennifer Aniston did not spend $100,000 on makeover months after her split from Justin Theroux.

Rumors about the actress getting a makeover to show Theroux what he’s missing are not true. A handful of tabloids claimed that Aniston is still getting over Theroux, but she wants to show him that she’s doing much better since they broke up.

The speculations heightened after Theroux was spotted hanging out with Emma Stone in while serving as brand ambassadors for Louis Vuitton. Some tabloids reported that Theroux and Stone are an item, but rumor-debunking site Gossip Cop clarified that they are simply working professionals.

Prior to the clarification, a tabloid said that Aniston got hurt over the thought that Theroux moved on from her very quickly.

“So Jen decided the best revenge was to focus on herself. Jen’s been feeling more and more insecure about looking older, and her split from Justin only made her feel worse… She knows she can’t compete with 20- and 30-something women,” the tabloid noted.

The same publication also said that Aniston consulted with professionals to help improve her physical appearance.

“She’s already consulted with some of the most advanced and progressive anti-aging specialists in Hollywood. She started having anti-aging IV drips and diamond facials, which are setting her back $7000 each time. She’s also doing Evian water baths twice a day – which is costing Jen around $70,000 per week,” the tabloid claimed.

However, Gossip Cop alleged that there is no truth to any of these rumors. Aniston is not getting a pricey makeover at the moment. And if she is, it has nothing to do with Theroux and their recent split.

In related news, Aniston also made headlines on Saturday after her former co-star, Courtney Cox, expressed her love for the 49-year-old actress. Cox has also supported Aniston through her split from Theroux.

A source told E! News in February that among all of her female friends, Aniston has leaned on Cox the most following the fall out of her relationship.

-33469609,Taylor Swift Wants to 'Set Down Roots' With Joe Alwyn in England,"Update, 4/6, 7:40 a.m.: It turns out The Sun's report truly is just a wild rumor with no truth to it. Gossip Cop reports that an insider close to Swift confirmed she is not house-searching in England at all—especially as she's about to set off on her Reputation world tour this spring.

Original, 4/5, 5:35 p.m.: Taylor Swift, the pop star and very secretive girlfriend of British actor Joe Alwyn, is ready to commit! To England full-time, that is. The Sun's Dan Wootton—the guy who broke the news the two were secretly dating last May—reports that Swift is looking for a North London house to make her home base. Alwyn and his family live in North London's Crouch End; Swift would like to be near that and the countryside near Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, outside of the city. (Soho Farmhouse, by the way, is where Meghan Markle had her swanky bridal shower.)

“Taylor loves the UK and how she can live a relatively normal life without being disturbed,"" the source said. The Sun previously reported that Swift went undetected in disguises around the city. “Setting down roots is something she’s thought long and hard about. She’s set aside £30 million ($42 million) to find the house of her dreams, which she hopes to one day settle down in with Joe if their relationship continues to grow.""



The leading requirement for this house is that it has multiple kitchens. “Two mega kitchens are an absolute requirement as she wants one near her entertaining area to be kept clean,"" the source continued. This is because Swift loves cooking oh-so much. Her passion for it is so intense, Alwyn reportedly calls her his ""feeder,"" per The Sun.

This isn't Swift's only property, of course. Swift has a penthouse apartment in New York City, a Beverly Hills house that's also a historic landmark, the Rhode Island beach house where she throws her Fourth of July parties, and a penthouse apartment in Nashville (plus a house there, too).

Previously, Swift rented a home in London, then started staying at Alwyn's so much that his friends joked ""it’s as if she’s moved in with him,"" a source told The Sun earlier this year.",fake

The engaged couple is squabbling about where to live, as In Touch has learned.

“Miley is happy staying put in Malibu, but Liam wants to raise a family in Australia,” a source tells In Touch in the issue currently on newsstands. “They’re fighting nonstop.”

Apparently, the 28-year-old Hunger Games heartthrob covets his family members’ life Down Under. His brother Chris Hemsworth and Chris’s wife, Elsa Pataky, are currently renovating their home in Byron Bay, a beachside town in New South Wales. “He sees how much happier his brother Chris is since putting down roots there,” the source adds. “Liam’s parents and extended family are all there.”

Liam apparently isn’t as dazzled by Tinseltown as his fiancée is. “He doesn’t like being surrounded by industry people like Miley does,” this insider explains.

As much as Miley may share Liam’s love for Australia, her whole life is in California. And it sounds like the Younger Now singer is worried about transcontinental separation anxiety. “She thinks she’ll feel isolated and lonely,” In Touch‘s source says. “She’s willing to take extended trips, but she refuses to uproot her entire life.”

Even if the 25-year-old doesn’t want to live abroad, she at least wants to head overseas for her wedding, it seems. The couple is planning to tie the knot in the Himalayas, a different source told Life & Style in March. “Miley has a real hippie side and wants to embrace that rather than spending millions,” the source said. “She wants to focus on the spiritual side of marriage and is very interested in Hinduism, so she is looking at locations in Nepal, where Hinduism is a way of life.”

So before Miley and Liam’s nuptials, we’ll give them some pre-marital counseling, free of charge. They should just split their time between the two continents. Problem solved, right?",fake

(Move over, Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson!) With Kanye’s behavior growing more erratic by the second, no one can blame the mother-of-three for wanting a divorce.

According to Life & Style, Kim believes Kanye is too focused on his career right now, and she’s “done with her husband always putting himself first.” When the rapper announced he’ll be dropping two new albums in June, it was the final straw.

Trouble is, Kim and Kanye have kids in the mix — North, 4, Saint, 2, and Chicago, three months — who make the situation all the more complicated. “Kim is pissed that [Kanye will] be off traveling the world promoting his music while she’s left at home feeling like a single mom with three small kids,” the source explained. “She accuses Kanye of being selfish.” Kanye definitely doesn’t see things that way. In fact, he “disagrees and blames ‘selfish’ Kim for their issues,” noted the source. “He doesn’t believe Kim is always there for him.”

Despite the 40-year-old’s reservations about his wife’s support, Kim has been on Team Kanye since the beginning — making his claims all the more outlandish. Even after her sisters Kylie, Khloé, and Kourtney all unfollowed Kanye on Twitter for his Trump-loving rant, she defended him.

In fact, Kim didn’t just risk family, but friends too! John Legend and wife Chrissy Teigen both unfollowed Kanye in the wake of his “MAGA” tweets, Pedestrian reports, as did Harry Styles, Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna, Teyana Taylor, and Travis Scott.

While the KKW Beauty mogul was willing to put up with Kanye’s antics then, she’s had enough. With two young children and an infant at home, it’s just gotten out of hand. “Kim is tired of covering for him and putting out fires that he keeps creating,” added the insider. “She can’t take it anymore.”",fake

However, it turns out that the Real Housewives of Atlanta star‘s latest get-rich-quick plan isn’t panning out so far.

According to Life & Style, NeNe is trying to get paid to endorse a major weight-loss product but isn’t getting any bites from companies.

“NeNe’s put on a few extra pounds,�? says a source, “so she’s been reaching out to companies in hopes of getting a deal like Oprah Winfrey has with Weight Watchers, or Marie Osmond has with Nutrisystem.�?

But it seems that companies aren’t interested.

Why do you ask?

NeNe “is a hothead,�? sources say. “No big company wants to gamble that she can keep her attitude at bay.�?

Adding that, “she sticks her foot in her mouth way too much.�?

A perfect example of NeNe’s hotheaded ways is the not so funny rape joke she made during a stand-up show a few months back.

I think NeNe would be a good spokesperson on a good day, but then again she has a nasty side she can’t always keep in check. Good PR is everything, and NeNe’s antics don’t always make that easy.

Thoughts on this rumor? Do you think NeNe is a hothead? Does NeNe need to change her ways to keep growing her fortune?

Kate Middleton and Prince William despite their stature in the world are not spared from rumors and unfounded reports that put the royal couple in a bad light. One of them is the report that they snubbed the power couple Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

The report said that Kardashian feels that Middleton and Prince William are snubbing or disinterested in meeting her and her husband. The royal couple allegedly turned down the invitation to attend West's concert a couple of times. The ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" star feels that it is snobbery towards her.

The mother of two was not in good terms with Beyonce. She knew that the royal couple met with her during a Nets game with her husband Jay Z. Kardashian feels that Beyonce has an edge over her. Kim Kardashian was allegedly hurt especially that Middleton is her idol.

Gossip Cop debunked the above-mentioned report as fake news because it was not from a reliable source. Knowing the Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge are busy people, missing an invitation is unlikely but if not done beforehand, the possibility is that it cannot be accommodated into their schedules.

The Siver Times reiterated a report that the royal couple saw Kim Kardashian and her husband as a has-been. In 2015, a report has mentioned that Kim and her husband has been inviting the royal couple but were turned down again and again.

Kim sent Princess Charlotte a custom-made dress from Kanye's clothing line but it was returned. One time, when Kim heard that Middleton was coming to the White House, she reportedly asked then First Lady Michelle Obama to have them met. But the First Lady declined.

They plan to remain best friends.

The normally private pair decided to break the news of their break-up with a statement from their publicist.

“Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.”

Jennifer Aniston is one of those celebs that people pull for.

She’s low key, low scandal, seemingly low maintenance.

We want her to find everlasting love.

So, what if Jenn got back together with Brad Pitt?

They were Hollywood’s it couple when they married in July 2000, but the relationship ended 5-years-later when Aniston filed for divorce.

Brad is single now too, having split with Angelina Jolie in 2016.

There was that rumor that he reached out to Jennifer after the break-up and E! News reported in January that Brad is casually getting back into the dating scene.

They wouldn’t be the first celebrity couple to give love a second shot.

Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are back on after breaking off their engagement in 2013.

She’s now wearing the ring he proposed with.

Plus, singer Pink and her husband Carey Hart separated after two years of marriage, but never divorced and rekindled their relationship a year later.

Instagram’s new Ask Me Anything feature may be the best thing the app has come up with! Without it, we may never have known that Orlando Bloom, 41, wants more kids. Although he has a son named Flynn with his ex Miranda Kerr, the actor has been dating Katy Perry, 33, on and off since 2016 — and now it’s looking like they may be ready to take things to the next level. Well, Orlando is at least. After posting on his Insta story, “I’m waiting to go to set ask me a question,” one fan asked if he wanted to have kids. His answer? “Yes I love being a dad.”

As if his answer wasn’t sweet enough, Orlando even posted it with a smiling selfie. Now if that big grin doesn’t make it clear how he feels about having more kids, we don’t know what does! Wondering if Katy feels the same? Good thing a source close to her told Hollywoodlife EXCLUSIVELY, “Katy doesn’t want to make things very secret with Orlando Bloom, and if he wanted to marry her and have children, she would be all in. She has jokingly said to friends she would be a baby-making machine for him, but it is something that is drenched in truth.”

We’ll just let that sink in for a sec… These two are both excited about starting a fam — so what are they waiting for? We hope to see a baby announcement from Orlando and Katy sooner rather than later.

With rumors flying around that Beyonce and Jay-Z are expecting a fourth, not to mention that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are trying for their first, it sounds like there are going to be a lot of cute kiddos running around this time next year.

Rumor debunking site, Gossip Cop, recently countered the statements made by National Enquirer about the “Maleficent” actress.

The tabloid quoted an unnamed source who said, “Superstar Angelina Jolie is wealthy enough to shop anywhere, but when it came to the holidays, she was all about bargains. Angie loves Target. It’s one of her favorite stores, and it’s where she buys lots of Christmas gifts. Walking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.”

Gossip Cop stressed that there’s no truth to such claims, and reiterated that it all started after Radar Online published a story about Jolie struggling with her finances. The tabloid claimed that Jolie has opted to buy discounted items at Target because of her money problems.

However, there’s also no truth to such rumors because the actress’ net worth is roughly around $160 million. She has just completed a series of successful projects, namely, “First They Killed My Father” and “The Breadwinner,” which generated huge sums of money.

Meanwhile, Jolie was also spotted at Target with her two kids, Shiloh, and Vivienne in August. The trio wanted to buy food at the store, but immediately left Target after they learned that it was no longer available.

Gossip Cop also stressed the fact that there’s no truth to the claims made by the sister sites because even their statements contradicted each other. Last week, Radar Online quoted their source, “Walking around with her shopping cart makes her feel normal again.”

National Enquirer, on the other hand, wrote, “Walking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.”

But regardless of where Jolie wants to shop, the most important thing is that she gets to spend time with her six children. The single mom has joint custody of her kids with Brad Pitt. The actor only has visitation rights to see their children, but all six of them are living with Jolie under one roof.

It took them two years, a superhero franchise and a countless trips to the Brentwood farmer’s market, but Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have officially filed for divorce.

The couple apparently coordinated their filing sans lawyers, according to TMZ, which was first to break the news, with Garner sending her court papers in Thursday and Affleck responding shortly after.

The two are seeking joint legal and physical custody of their children, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 4, so it looks like they’re avoiding a Brangelina-style situation entirely.

The decision to officially divorce comes amid speculation that the former Hollywood golden twosome were reconciling, as the two have continued to act very much like a couple (going on vacations together, praising each other in the press and co-parenting their children) since announcing their split in June 2015.

But according to sources per People magazine, Garner and Affleck have taken their sweet time to iron out the details, like division of property and assets, as well as spousal support, since they do not have a prenuptial agreement.

The two reportedly remain “super amicable” and have done everything with their children in mind.

“They always planned to divorce despite what people said. If you look at their first statement it says divorce, not separate,” a source told the magazine. “They just did it the way they wanted to and did what was best for their kids. There was no catalyst, it was just time. Nothing has changed, they are and still will be putting their kids first.”

The surprise guest arrived behind a podium like the one in the White House press briefing room. “This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period. Both in person and around the world,” he declared with firm conviction.

He was making fun of his own unwavering assertion about the viewership of Trump’s January inauguration. At the sight of him, several celebrities — most notably Melissa McCarthy, who famously played Spicer on Saturday Night Live — had strong reactions.

Anna Chumskly of Veep had the most meme-worthy natural reaction. Consider it whenever you need to communicate a combination of awe and disbelief.

Perhaps knowing that all eyes would be on her, Melissa McCarthy, who won an Emmy for her SNL impression of Spicer, kept it cool.

We miss the old Kanye… Ahead of the release of his new album, Kanye West has been tweeting non-stop and proclaiming his love for Donald Trump. Now, it is being revealed he has a big request for the President — and it involves his youngest daughter Chicago.

“Kanye’s infatuated with Trump and is considering asking POTUS to be Chicago’s godfather,” a source told In Touch exclusively. “He loves, respects, and admires Trump and feels a man of his prestige and power would be a perfect influence in children’s lives.”

However, his wife Kim Kardashian is completely opposed to the idea. “She despises Trump and doesn’t like what he stands for and is telling Kanye that he needs to choose somebody else. Kanye’s adamant that he wants to ask Trump and it’s resulted in them having a huge blowout argument,” the source added. “Trump is a huge no no for Kim but Kanye’s really a huge fan and supporter of his and that’s a bone of contention in their marriage.”

In case you were wondering, North and Saint West‘s godmothers are Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian, respectively. However, their godfathers have never been revealed.

Earlier this week, it was reported that friends were worried the “Faded” rapper are worried about his current mental health after he spoke with radio host Ebro and allegedly said he loved Trump — along with claim he had an opioid addiction. On Twitter, Kanye has denied the allegations.

“There’s been a lot of fake news so I just wanted to give you the facts,” he wrote. “Yeezy will become the biggest apparel company in human history by working with the most genius level talents and creating product at an affordable price. I hired the head of supply chain from the Gap.” He also called himself this generation’s “Ford Hughes Jobs Disney.”

Let's just say that if you attempted this in the gym with your partner, it probably wouldn't go this smoothly. Asghari actually bench presses Spears, and in another crazy move, she does a plank while perched on his back as he's doing pushups. Whoa! ""Stronger together,"" Spears wrote in the caption. You just have to watch it to believe it (also their situp kisses are too cute).

The 2018 Grammy Awards were almost perfect, but there was someone huge missing: Justin Bieber! The “Sorry” singer, 23, skipped the Grammys on January 28 and opted to stay back home in Los Angeles during Music’s Biggest Night. He wasn’t having a quiet night in Netflix and Chilling with Selena Gomez, though. Biebs hit the town with his guys, instead. TMZ caught up with him while he was leaving Mr. Chow in LA instead of hitting the stage in NYC to sing the “Despacito” remix with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. Uh oh!

Now, don’t get it wrong. Justin loves himself some Luis and Daddy, but he’s got bigger fish to fry at home. JB’s allegedly working on a new album, and, according to TMZ, he doesn’t want to make any major appearances until it’s finished. Well, that’s exciting! Hopefully, that’s true. Justin’s also skipped the Grammys in the past just for kicks, though, so it could just be a case of simply not wanting to go. After all, he clearly didn’t even watch the show since he was out with his friends.

Selena wasn’t with the crew, even though she also wasn’t at the Grammys. As HollywoodLife.com told you EXCLUSIVELY, Selena doesn’t have anything to worry about when Justin hangs without her! When he was partying it up at Poppy Nightclub in LA just a couple days before the Grammys, an eyewitness told us that he looked happy and relaxed, and that there was no funny business going on. Justin never “flirted or danced or carried on with any girls,” the eyewitness told us.

Having a boyfriend in the music business has been a blessing and a curse for Selena Gomez. The Weeknd totally has a crazy schedule like her, but it means they can’t always be together. “Selena misses her boyfriend dearly as she is hard at work with her music career which is taking off again,” a source in the industry revealed EXCLUSIVELY to HollywoodLife.com. “Selena’s music obligations mean time away from her amazing boyfriend Abel whose own music career is just as busy.”

Selena totally knocked it out of the park with her latest single “Fetish,” but she reportedly has been thinking of her BF a ton. “It is bittersweet for Selena who feels accomplished with all of the great music she is putting out,” the insider continued. “She just wishes Abel could be by her side every step of the way. They both have down time coming soon and have made plans for another romantic rendezvous and she can’t wait to be back in his arms.” Long distance relationships have got to be super stressful for any couple, but that just makes the time together all the more special. “While the time apart is tough, the reunions are always explosive. Abel really turns Selena on and she gets giddy just thinking about spending another night with him,” the source revealed.

The “It Ain’t Me” singer has got so much going with her music right now, you can’t blame her for making the most of it. Thankfully The Weeknd has been in the business for a long time like Sel so they’ve probably bonded over it. “Selena is proud of her art which she knows is important and she has equal respect for Abel and his ambitions. She is OK with them both chasing their dreams and goals in life. But that doesn’t mean she still doesn’t miss him every minute they are apart and she looks forward to when she can be with him every single day again,” the source told us.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Selena and The Weeknd are meant to be? Are you super excited to them reunited?",fake

Andy Cohen, executive producer of the show, also denied the report tweeting to a fan that Manigault was “too busy running the country” to film the series. She’s currently President Donald Trump’s director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison.

There were rumors “Real Housewives of Atlanta” was getting a new cast member.

Cohen also seemed to take a jab at Manigault writing that her joining “Real Housewives of Atlanta” would be an end to his sanity.

But it was Katie who decided to pull the plug entirely — and she told him they should just “cancel altogether!” UPDATE: A rep for Jamie has denied these reports, and says the singer was “never engaged.”

“Everything was going so well,” the mag’s insider claims. “But with this latest development, it’s understandable that Katie would start to feel insecure about the relationship. And she definitely wouldn’t want to raise another child on her own, as she’s been forced to do with Suri since she left Tom [Cruise].”

Katie is reportedly four months pregnant with her and Jamie’s baby girl, but according to the source, he plans on sticking by her, regardless of their relationship status.

“They love each other and everyone says they are really good together,” the insider explains. “Katie just has to get over this stumbling block. It’s the first real issue they’ve had, and while it’s a big one, it shouldn’t be a deal breaker.” This couple was first linked in 2013, although they’ve both made it a point to keep their romantic relationship private.

“They are still both receiving individual therapy,” a source tells PEOPLE of the couple. “Kim is dealing with the trauma from the robbery. Kanye is receiving help for depression and learning how to cope with stress better.”

“They might be thinking about couples therapy, but so far it seems they haven’t had any sessions together,” the source adds.

The Wests’ marriage has been the topic of conversation since 36-year-old Kim’s October robbery and Kanye’s recent hospitalization for exhaustion, but a source close to the couple revealed to PEOPLE last week that “splitting is not even a point of discussion.”

“Truly no truth behind divorce rumors. It’s not something she would divorce him over,” the source said, adding, “He had a breakdown, but it does not pertain to them not getting along.”

Kim and Kanye have rarely been photographed together since October, though they did step out for a casual dinner for two at the Santa Monica restaurant Giorgio Baldi this past Sunday.

-3071314990,Angelina Jolie: The Shock Diet Causing Actress To Lose Weight Amid Brad Pitt Divorce Drama,"Angelina Jolie is allegedly surviving on little to no food, with sources questioning whether the stress of her divorce with Brad Pitt is to blame for her weight loss.

According to OK! Magazine, as cited by Gossip Cop, the actress has developed a smoking habit that’s so bad, she finds herself smoking an entire pack every single day, and to make matters worse, Angelina Jolie isn’t eating much on top of that.

Sources tell the publication that the A-list actress wakes up in the morning and finds herself smoking with a cup of coffee before the kids wake up, and she reportedly breaks the habit until her children are fast asleep before she carries on again.

Supposedly, Angelina Jolie smokes heavily throughout the morning and evening, and in the afternoon, there’s nothing that she consumes other than French cheese and expensive wine, which has greatly affected her weight, an insider stresses.

She’s nowhere near as healthy as she used to be, but the outlet fails to mention what her actual reasons are for this drastic diet she’s adapted to, though fans would want to believe that it’s presumably due to the supposed stress dealing with her divorce from Brad Pitt.

Whatever the case may be, it’s evidently clear that Angelina Jolie has been losing weight, which sources tell OK! Magazine is simply through the way that the mother of six has been treating herself as of late.

Angelina Jolie has never shied away from her dark past, which consisted of multiple health issues, but she has never commented on people’s recent concerns regarding her weight loss.

A statement regarding new claims about her unhealthy food intake will most likely not be addressed by the actress, for she has stayed away from even commenting on anything that concerns her weight.

Angelina Jolie has yet to finalize her divorce from Brad Pitt, as the couple continues to work out a custody plan with visitation rights that they are both in agreement with.

Despite OK! Magazine‘s claims, Gossip Cop‘s sources question the credibility of the outlet’s insiders, insisting that the story regarding Angelina Jolie’s weight loss is far from true.

Jolie famously filed for divorce last September, with reports at the time claiming that Pitt’s alcohol addiction had gotten so out of hand, it was beginning to affect everyone’s life around him, including his own family.

While the stylish singer and TV personality is known for rocking some unusual outfits -- like the full-body black and blue catsuit she wore on a recent live episode of AGT -- many fans are speculating that this dress might be a not-so-subtle comment on her contentious divorce.

The 42-year-old entertainer is currently in a long and acrimonious split from her ex, Stephen Belafonte. Mel filed for divorce in March, after nearly 10 years of marriage.

The following month, the singer got a restraining order against her estranged husband, alleging that Belafonte beat and threatened her throughout their nearly 10-year marriage.

Days later, Belafonte, who denied the allegations, responded when he filed a petition seeking joint custody of their 5-year-old daughter, Madison, and requesting spousal support and that Mel pay his legal fees.

They swore at the time they were just friends (""We have just stayed close and there's nothing more to it than that,"" she told E! News), but the attraction was growing. By the time a pal was characterizing their coupling as ""more than just a fling"" in early 2016, Bieber was reaching for the right words to define it as well.

You see, he'd learned a bit from his rollercoaster romance with Gomez. He wasn't going to recklessly dive into this union, hands in the air. Though he described the Drop the Mic host as ""someone I really love"" in his February 2016 GQ profile, he was careful not to label the connection they shared. ""I don't want to put anyone in a position where they feel like I'm only theirs, only to be hurt in the end,"" he shared. ""Right now in my life, I don't want to be held down by anything. I already have a lot that I have to commit to. A lot of responsibilities. I don't want to feel like the girl I love is an added responsibility.""

This wasn't about being free to party with groupies, he insisted, but rather a different, and dare we say more mature, way of approaching a relationship. ""I know that in the past I've hurt people and said things that I didn't mean to make them happy in the moment,"" he continued. ""So now I'm just more so looking at the future, making sure I'm not damaging them. What if Hailey ends up being the girl I'm gonna marry, right? If I rush into anything, if I damage her, then it's always gonna be damaged. It's really hard to fix wounds like that. It's so hard.… I just don't want to hurt her.""",fake

Cops found Moran, who played Joanie Cunningham on the iconic sitcom, unconscious in New Salisbury, Indiana, on Saturday before she was pronounced dead.

It’s believed she died of an heroin OD, the Daily Mail reported.

Harrison County Sheriff’s deputies declined comment on Sunday, only saying that they got a 911 call at 4:07 p.m. on Saturday and found an unresponsive Moran.

“It was determined that Erin Marie Moran Fleischmann was deceased. An autopsy is pending,” according to a sheriff’s statement.

Moran was 56.

“May people remember Eric for her contagious smile, warm heart, and animal loving soul,” her “Joanie Love Chachi” co-star Scott Baio tweeted on Sunday.

“I always hoped she could find peace in her life. God has you now, Erin.”

Moran’s “Happy Days” mom, Marion Ross, also said Sunday she wished to remember the child star in happier times.

“This breaks my heart,” Moran’s TV mom Ross, 88, told NBC in Los Angeles. “She was the quickest, fastest little kid. Wonderful.”

Moran is the third regular cast member of the show to die since “Happy Days” went off the air in 1984 — following TV dad Tom Bosley (2010) and Arnold’s owners Al Molinaro (2015) and Pat Morita (2005).",fake

Jonas and Turner have been dating since at least last November and went public just this past January. Playing coy about her relationship at the Golden Globes that month, Turner flashed a bejeweled finger for the camera and joked: “And my engagement ring that isn’t really an engagement ring.” The very famous couple have kept their relationship low key ever since; Jonas attended the Los Angeles premiere of Game of Thrones this past summer with Turner but didn’t walk the red carpet by her side. In fact, the pair have never been photographed together in any official capacity and have only appeared together very rarely on each other’s social media accounts and in paparazzi shots.

Given their private nature, the couple have not revealed any further details on their engagement—as in how long they are going to wait to tie the knot.

Kristen Stewart and Alicia Cargile were seen smiling after they stepped out from a restaurant in Los Feliz.

Actress Kristen Stewart was spotted enjoying a romantic lunch date with her girlfriend, Alicia Cargile. The 26-year-old Cafe Society star and Cargile were seen smiling, after they stepped out from a restaurant in Los Feliz, reported People magazine.

Stewart was seen in a white t-shirt along with black jeggings and funky chain pendant over her neck, and her partner also kept it casual in a black top with a cap. The actress made their relationship public last month, acknowledging that she is happy with her girl more than any man she had earlier been with.

Earlier,Kristen Stewart said she watches her previous performances time and again to improve herself. The 26-year-old Twilight star believes that it is good to look back at her performances on the big screen as it helps her to become a better actress in the future, reported Female First. “I’ve been wanting to make movies forever and I want to direct and write and keep acting forever, so it makes me better to watch the performance. Advertisement “It’s enlightening, and not in a technical way – it’s not like I go, ‘Ooh, I saw my face do this and now I know how to cry onscreen.’ It’s more like, if you can correlate the experience of making the movie to the final product, it affects how you carry on from that point”, she said. Earlier, the 26-year-old actress worked with the filmmaker onCafe Society and initially thought he “regretted” casting her, so was determined to prove herself on set, reported Female First. “I thought, ‘He hates me! He absolutely is regretting his decision’,” she recalled. “But, then, I was like, “I’m going to prove to this little dude that I can absolutely do this!”Stewart revealed. Allen, 80, criticised her for her looks and said she wasn’t pretty enough.”

-2981124886,Travis Scott Is Starting to Doubt If He's Stormi's Dad Amid Tim Chung Rumors,"Earlier this month, rumors started swirling that Kylie Jenner‘s daughter Stormi Webster might not be her boyfriend Travis Scott’s child because of the shocking resemblence that Stormi has to Kylie’s hot AF bodyguard Tim Chung. Now that baby Stormi is four months old, she’s starting to show more defined features in her face and sources exclusively revealed to In Touch that there is a part of Travis that is starting to doubt Stormi’s paternity and whether or not he is the little girl’s father.

“Travis is starting to get a little worried and questioning Kylie about this whole bodyguard situation. Not to diss or say Kylie’s a liar but, he doesn’t watch her every move. He’s not with her 24/7 and there were times they were a part from each other nine months ago. He loves Stormi and truly believes that’s his daughter but can’t help but notice that she doesn’t look like him. In the back of his mind he wonders if Kylie strayed. If that happened and Stormi’s not his, that would be the most devastating news of his life. He flat out wants to talk to Kylie and Tim, together, to once and for all get to the bottom of this.”

Ever since Kylie started sharing more and more photos of baby Stormi, fans started to realize that Ky’s daugther kind of looks like she has some of Tim’s features and they started to point it out in the comments. And given the whirlwind nature of Kylie’s relationship with Travis — they started dating just one month after her split from her ex-boyfriend Tyga — and the fact that Travis was busy touring during the beginning of their relationship, it seems like there could have very well been a few instances where Kylie could have been alone with her security guard.

According to sources, Tim even bragged about how much alone time he has been able to spend with Kylie. “He’s telling his friends that he’s been alone with Kylie tons of times in her house but when they ask if [they’ve been intimate], he simply smiles,” and an insider revealed to In Touch.",fake

The famous pair shared the stage as they introduced previews for Cruise’s upcoming film Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Fonda’s Book Club – their flirty banter not going unnoticed by the audience.

According to onlookers, their flirting was evident to everyone and they couldn’t keep their hands off each other.

‘Tom was hanging on Jane’s every word, and she was touching his arm repeatedly and having a lot of fun – it was clear that they were really enjoying one another’s company. In fact, some were even wondering if there was more to their obvious connection and whether their chemistry would eventuate into something more. The flirting was off the scale.’

Jane, 80, who is famous for looking younger than her years and separating from her longtime boyfriend Richard Perry last year, is in the middle of a career renaissance and shows no sign of slowing down.

Tom, 55, has also enjoyed renewed success with a string of hit action films, and was last rumoured to be dating his Fallout co-star Vanessa Kirby.

‘Tom and Jane were certainly very taken with each other and everyone was talking about it,’ an insider tells New Idea.

‘They spent a couple of hours together, laughing and talking – it was really like there was no-one else at the party.

‘Sure, Jane is a little older than Tom – but he’s had older girlfriends before and this is the first woman in a really long time who’s managed to captivate him.

‘Tom was left feeling a little shell-shocked after his split from Katie, but he really wants to put himself back out there and find love again,’ the source added.

I read the song and I go, ‘Babe, it sounds like they’re talking about us.’ And she goes, ‘Yeah. They made it for me.’ I heard it for the first time and I knew it was going to be a smash the first time I heard it.”

Lopez, 48, previously said “El Anillo” is about women ready for the rock.

“The song is definitely about that, it is, but I felt like it was kind of something that all women get to a point where they say, ‘OK, what’s up?'” the thrice-married star explained. “Like we’re good, everything’s great, what’s going on? Am I staying or am I [going]?”

Khloe Kardashian ‘Riddled With Anxiety’ And ‘Isolated’ While Expecting!,"We have learned that the alleged mom-to-be is having a hard time with her pregnancy, not because of any complications but because it has been isolating her and pushing her closest friends away. Just like Kylie, Khloe also reportedly feels really lonely while waiting to welcome her first child with basketball player boyfriend, Tristan Thompson. Much like her younger half-sister’s situation, it looks like Khloe’s road to motherhood is just a neverending nightmare.

The 33-year-old is apparently, ‘unmotivated’ and ‘tired’ all the time but that’s not all – she’s also very anxious and feels isolated in Tristan’s adopted hometown of Cleveland.

That is definitely not good for her or her baby, but she just can’t help it – she feels horrible!

‘Her anxiety is going from bad to worse. She is lonely being away from her family,’ one source close to the Kardashian family revealed.

Khloe, who’s struggled with her body image and weight in the past is also devastated reading mean comments from fans that make fun of her curvier figure now that she is expecting.

‘There is the body-shaming, which has been off the charts lately. She cannot wait for this pregnancy to be over and done with,’ the insider added.

In addition, Khloe has been suffering horrible morning sickness all throughout her first trimester and also often complains about her hair thinning to pals.

Similarly, Kylie Jenner is also expecting her first child, rumors say and is terrified of how much weight she has gained.

The pregnancy body is scaring her so much that she refuses to leave the house.

Although for years the timing was never right, ‘Julia and Richard are undeniably drawn to each other and always have been,’ claims a source. So far that has always meant being in the friend zone.

The Hollywood pair are said to have reached out to each other in 2015 when they were both going through a tough time – Julia rumoured to have begun a trial separation with husband Danny Moder late last year.



‘They both were going through a rough time and poured their hearts out to each other,’ continues the insider, who notes that Richard was going through a messy divorce from second wife, actress Carey Lowell.



‘Their heart-to-hearts eventually led to discreet dinner dates in L.A, sometimes in private restaurant dining rooms, where they’d be left uninterrupted and could stay past closing hours.’



However, the American Gigolo star eventually got back together with much younger girlfriend Alejandra Silva, 35 – with the pair even rumoured to have secretly eloped with during a trip to France .

MTV said on Monday that “Lohan Beach Club” will follow the actress as she works to expand a recently launched nightclub and restaurant business in Greece.

The TV network said the show, expected to air in 2019, will see Lohan, 32, lead a team of “brand ambassadors” who will help promote her business “while striving to rise above the temptations the Mykonos night life scene has to offer.”

Lohan, once one of Hollywood’s most-sought after young actresses after starring roles in “The Parent Trap” and “Mean Girls,” went to rehab six times between 2007 and 2013, and was in and out of jail and court repeatedly for offenses ranging from theft to drunken driving and drug possession.

Her last feature movie was the 2013 low-budget thriller “The Canyons” after which she moved to London, and later Dubai. Her biggest acting job since then is dark British TV comedy “Sick Note,” in which she plays a supporting role in the second season that began airing last week.

The Mykonos beach club is Lohan’s third business venture in Greece following the 2016 opening of a nightclub bearing her name in Athens and a beach house in Rhodes which is due to open this summer.",fake

‘They’ve been growing closer ever since Jen reached out to Brad after his split from Ange,’ a source told Star. ‘Jen has been a real source of comfort and strength for Brad, and during their long talks, they realised just how strong their bond still is.’

The publication goes on to claim that the duo have arranged to meet up on a skiing break. While she will be accompanied by close friends, it seems there is room for Brad.

‘When Jen mentioned that she was planning to go skiing with friends in Aspen after New Year’s, a light bulb went off in Brad’s head,’ claims Star’s source. ‘He said he could fly over in his private jet and meet up with her there.

‘He pointed out that they could even hit the slopes together, since no one would recognise them in their ski masks, goggles and helmets. Jen thought it was genius.

‘The trip is going to be a blast,’ claims the source, who adds, ‘I imagine Brad and Jen will steal private moments to they can have some emotional heart-to-hearts.’

So when the 22-year-old pop star was seen walking down the streets of West Hollywood, Los Angeles on Thursday with a giant wet stain on the crotch of his designer sweatpants, the Internet obviously just assumed Bieber had peed himself. (Yes, #JustinPeeber was a thing.)

But the “Love Yourself” singer has a totally reasonable explanation.

Late in the evening on Thursday, Biebs set the record straight about the source of the stain. “Someone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my d— area,” he tweeted.

You ain't cool unless you pee your pants A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Feb 23, 2017 at 12:58pm PST

“Didn’t bother me if it made ya laugh nice!” he added.

He also took to his newly reinstated Instagram to joke about the photos, posting a meme comparing his soaked sweatpants to the wet pants Adam Sandler rocked in Billy Madison.

“You ain’t cool unless you pee your pants,” Bieber wrote — quoting the scene from the 1995, in which Sandler pretends to pee his pants to so that school bullies will stop teasing another kid who actually did pee his pants.

Marion Cotillard, the French actress and Dior ambassador known for her demure and ladylike style, showed off a new, um, look on Instagram on Monday — complete with a dark wavy wig and full pout — that had us wondering if she had found a long-lost Kardashian kousin.

It was the 41-year-old’s plump lips (which she noted were for her role in the film, Rock’n Roll, which was released last month in France) that had her fans buzzing, with many drawing comparisons to Kylie Jenner’s infamous pout, as well as the full puckers of Rose McGowan and Angelina Jolie.

However, though Cotillard made it clear that the get-up was for a role, and not a personal choice, she appeared to be feeling it.

A post shared by @marioncotillard on Mar 6, 2017 at 3:05pm PST

The actress posted — count ’em — 18 selfies to give her fans a glimpse of every possible angle of the look, including several which showed off her cleavage. Cotillard, who is expecting a baby with partner Guillaume Canet (who also directed Rock’n Roll), utilized Instagram’s new photo gallery feature so as not to flood fans’ feeds.

The successive posts tie Rihanna’s record of 18 selfies in a 24-hour period, which the singer had posted in celebration of the Crop Over festival in her native Barbados in 2015.

-2830084039,Trump Rescinds Rules on Bathrooms for Transgender Students,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, overruling his own education secretary and placing his administration firmly in the middle of the culture wars that many Republicans have tried to leave behind.

In a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department rejected the Obama administration’s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice.

That directive, they said, was improperly and arbitrarily devised, “without due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy.”

The question of how to address the “bathroom debate,” as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting Education Secretary Betsy DeVos against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation.",fake

His relationship with Stefani—once brushed off by skeptics as a sure-to-be-short-lived rebound or so over-the-top that it simply must be fake—has rolled past the two-and-a-half year mark and right on by any claims that it's not the real deal.

Beyond being 100 percent authentic, the union, says the five-time Country Music Association Male Vocalist of the Year, is quite simply the best thing that ever happened to him. Yeah, going through his second divorce in a decade—this time from Miranda Lambert, the woman who'd loudly proclaimed such a separation wasn't an option—was admittedly not great. But after he and his fellow country powerhouse, 34, revealed the end of their four-year marriage in 2016, a surprising thing happened.

Stefani, his Voice cohort who he'd paid little notice to throughout their first season together in 2014 (""I mean, she was on the show, high five and 'good to see ya,'"" he recalled), approached him and whispered she was going through the exact same thing. Within weeks she would announce that she'd left husband of 13 years, Gavin Rossdale.",fake

Generally, when one celebrity is announced to be joining another star, the gossip magazines start spinning reports about (untrue) drama behind-the-scenes. So sadly, we won’t be surprised if there are fake news stories filled with made-up quotes from unnamed sources about how Strahan is supposedly upset by Rodriguez’s arrival or is battling the baseball player for scoops. Regardless, from what Gossip Cop hears from a mutual pal and network sources, Strahan is pretty pumped about Rodriguez joining the ABC team.

In addition to being athletes turned TV personalities, Strahan and Rodriguez have also both been the subject of a slew of inaccurate reports. Gossip Cop recently busted a magazine report that falsely alleged Strahan was feuding with Robin Roberts at “GMA.“ As we noted, the reality is the two anchors get along great. And just a week ago, Gossip Cop corrected a tabloid cover story that wrongly maintained Jennifer Lopez was pregnant with Rodriguez’s baby boy. Much like those articles and many others about Strahan and Rodriguez, there’s often a lot of fabricated drama, yet zero truth to the claims.",fake

Ladies, it’s time to take notes! The best way to get back at an ex-boyfriend is to look amazing. FKA Twigs, 30, latest Apple commercial (promoting the HomePod) has her ex-lover Robert Pattison, 31, reminiscing about the good old days. “He loves her very much still and seeing this commercial reminds him of how amazing she is. He sees her talent, he sees her smile, and watching it makes him happy since it such a time warp for him. It takes him back to when they were in a better place. It shows the best of everything about her. Now, will that lead him back to her? Never say never,” a source close to the Twilight star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. So sweet, right?

For those of you who haven’t seen the commercial, Robert isn’t exaggerating. FKA looks absolutely stunning in the ad directed by Spike Jones. In the four-minute clip, the gorgeous singer shows off her enticing dance moves to the tune of “Till It’s Over” by Anderson .Paak. The HomePod transforms her room into a dance floor, and we can’t get enough. No wonder Robert is so smitten. FKA’s commercial also marks her return to the spotlight. Since their breakup in 2017, FKA has kept a pretty low profile, and hasn’t put out any music. So, this is definitely the Friday pick-me-up we didn’t know we needed. Plus, just like Robert, we can’t help but take a trip down memory lane.

Robert and FKA were together for a little two years before deciding to call it quits. We certainly thought they were in it for the long hall as they had plans to get married.

“I’ve never met another woman like her and once you do, you want to be with her forever,” Scott, 38, tells PEOPLE of Phan, 31.

Scott has been planning the elaborate surprise for weeks, and was determined to keep his new fiancé off his trail as he coordinated every over-the-top moment. “I’ve had to be as stealthy as a ninja to pull this off,” he says. Scott even admitted he’s been carrying the ring around with him for weeks and has kept all planning offline so Phan couldn’t possibly come across any details accidentally.

The HGTV star, who has released two country singles with brother Jonathan, recently snuck off to New York City to record his own version of the Train song “Marry Me.” During tonight’s dinner, he arranged for the restaurant to play the track while he and Phan were having dinner, which cued the staff to bring out a cake decorated with illustrations from one of Phan’s favorite books, Dr. Seuss’s Oh the Places You’ll Go, tweaked to read “Oh the Places We’ll Go,” as a nod to their continuing journey together.

The festivities continued after dinner with a surprise engagement party at a nearby venue that Phan had been led to believe was a company holiday party. Friends and family, including both fiancés’ parents, as well as Scott siblings Jonathan and J.D., were all in attendance.

The 'Dawson's Creek' Star Issued Her First Public Statement About It,"It feels like a lifetime ago when we were living in the era of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise before the couple divorced in 2012 after a six-year marriage. Shortly after their breakup, Holmes has been linked to actor Jamie Foxx when they were spotted dancing together in the Hamptons.

Recently, a Radar! report surfaced that the couple had been planning a secret wedding and decided to split because Holmes, 39, had a ""sudden change of heart"" and ""couldn't get over her trust issues."" However, Holmes' rep completely shut down the rumors. ""The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” she told People.

The pair has technically never even confirmed their relationship in the first place. (Foxx left an ESPN interview when he was asked directly about Holmes and their Valentine's Day date.) They did, however, sit next to each other at Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January and were very loving and affectionate. They were also spotted on many date nights, but made sure to be coy about it.

In December, Holmes also attended Foxx's 50th birthday party along with Leo DiCaprio, Snoop Dogg, Tobey MacGuire, and more celebs. Foxx's daughters were also there, but Suri Cruise was nowhere in sight. (Perhaps a little too old of a scene for a 12-year-old.)

There's no rulebook that says any celebrity has to confirm or deny their relationship to the world, which makes it pretty nice that Holmes and Cruise can live their lives without answering to anybody.

This may just be the best news we’ve heard all day! Despite going through a bitter divorce, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will reportedly spend Christmas TOGETHER for the sake of their six children — Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9. Isn’t that great?! “They’re not getting back together, but that doesn’t mean they can’t celebrate as a family,” a source told OK! Magazine. “It will be the first time in a long time that they’ve all been in the same room together, so it’s likely to be bittersweet.” The report goes on to say that Brad has always liked to spoil his children, so Angelina “softened to the idea of him playing Santa” on Christmas morning.

“The holidays make Brad really sentimental about family and especially about his kids. Pampering them makes him feel good, and Angie doesn’t want to interfere with that,” the source further explained. And in what may be a way of repaying her, Brad and his production company Plan B will reportedly “step out and publicly support” Angie’s movie First They Killed My Father. “After their split, Angie lost a lot of studio friends who sided with Brad,” the source said. “His support would go a long way toward mending their friendship.”

“Brad and Angie still care a lot about each other and by now, both want to be kind. The holiday season is the perfect time for new beginnings,” the source concluded.

Oct. 8 -- Gwyneth Paltrow says she wasn't surprised to see her ex-boyfriend Ben Affleck's planned wedding to Jennifer Lopez be put on hold last month.

""Ben makes life tough for himself,"" Paltrow told ABCNEWS' Diane Sawyer in an exclusive interview airing in full on Primetime Thursday. ""He's got a lot of complication, and you know, he really is a great guy. So I hope he sorts himself out.""

Paltrow dated Affleck on and off for two years, but says she never expected to end up with him. ""I just think we have a very different sort of value system,"" she said.

Nowadays, the blonde-tressed actress is dating Coldplay singer Chris Martin. She broke up with Affleck for good in October 2000, and says she no longer communicates with him.

An Enduring Grace

Paltrow is back in her hometown of New York after spending some time abroad. It's a busy time for the 31-year-old star, who has taken a challenging new role in the movie Sylvia, about the life of American poet and novelist Sylvia Plath. She is also coping with the loss of her father, producer-director Bruce Paltrow, who passed away last year.

From her early stardom in Emma (1996), to her Oscar-winning role in Shakespeare in Love (1998) and her singing debut in Duets (2000), Paltrow has managed to maintain a certain grace while living her adult life in front of the cameras. The scrutiny was ongoing through the breakup of her engagement with Brad Pitt and then, those two years with Affleck.

While they were dating, Affleck told Good Morning America that he believed Paltrow's perfect man would be someone like her dad. She said that his perfect woman would be ""any sort of stripper at Scores. Anyone that serves cold beer in a bikini.""",fake

Selena Gomez’s reported reunion with Justin Bieber is a footnote compared to what E! News reports as a “complicated relationship” between the singer and her mom Mandy Teefey. According to one source, the mother-daughter pair have endured “a lot of ups and downs” on top of an “entire year” of not speaking to each other after Mandy was let go of her managerial duties in 2014. As the source explains, things got so bad Selena wasn’t even allowed to talk to her 4-year-old sister Gracie.

E! News’ source says that Mandy had a “really hard time” making 13 Reasons Why happen after the firing because she was so “emotionally and professionally” affected. “It caused a major rift in their relationship but they eventually reconnected.” Flash forward to March 2017: the show is an instant hit on Netflix and at the premiere, mother and daughter happily pose for photos together on the red carpet.

Earlier this month, TMZ reported that Mandy was briefly hospitalized in Los Angeles after she having a “heated” conversation with Selena about her relationship with Justin. At the time, sources said police performed a welfare check on Mandy after being contacted by a family member. According to E! News, Justin and Selena’s reported reconciliation has caused “so much angst” in her family, who are allegedly “very sad” about their reunion. “Selena is dealing with some family issues at the moment and Justin is there for her,” adds a source. “He doesn’t want to cause any problems between Selena and her mom… Justin and Selena are still together.”

In fact, just weeks before the cringeworthy encounter, the ""Tin Man"" singer sent Blake and his longtime love Gwen Stefani — who plan to tie the knot and have a baby sometime soon — a touching message of support through mutual acquaintances.

The two country musicians, who infamously split in 2015, had a messy divorce. Even still, Miranda has let go of all the bitterness and no longer holds a grudge. A source previously told Life & Style, “It was the last thing Gwen expected, but it was a very sweet, simple message wishing her the best.” Miranda's “given her blessing to Blake,” the insider added. “Deep down, they do want the best for each other.”

Now, this exchange took place prior to the ACM, so, whether or not Miranda still maintains her blessing, remains to be seen. It's possible that her recent split from Anderson East — whom she dated for two years — could explain her icy demeanor at the award show.

A witness who spoke to In Touch magazine explained that Miranda refused to make eye contact with Blake and Gwen — who were in her line of vision — while accepting her award for Song of the Year for “Tin Man."" The song comes from Miranda's album, The Weight of These Wings, which she wrote following her divorce from Blake. On top of that, she thanked her fans for sharing her “broken heart.""

Was she throwing shade or did Miranda just not want to be bothered watching her ex canoodle with his new love while she's mending yet another broken heart? We'll let you decide.

Jennifer Aniston’s hubby, Justin Theroux, and her bestie, Courteney Cox, have been Team Aniston cheerleaders this week, doing their part to keep their girl out of the Brangelina split narrative.

“I feel like we’re exacerbating it by even talking about it,” Aniston’s forever Friend and former co-star told Entertainment Tonight Tuesday while at the Chateau Marmont for Revlon’s Annual Philanthropic Luncheon. “It’s not about her.” We tend to agree, since Aniston and Brad Pitt divorced 11 years ago. Still, the Aniston jokes came flooding in when news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce, even though Aniston has been happily married to Theroux since 2015.

Jolie/Pitt divorce: Now what?

The Girl on the Train actor addressed the Brangelina breakup with Business Insider Monday.

“As a child of divorce, all I can say is that's terrible news for those children, and that's all you can really say,” Theroux stated. “It's boring to sort of comment on anything else.”

He also said tabloids making Aniston a part of the saga is just the latest instance of “nonsense.”

“There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite,"" The Leftovers star said. ""But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to (expletive) about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.”

“I do consider Emily my best friend. She’s this wonderful, elegant person,” Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie) says of Lively’s character in the preview, which the latter debuted Wednesday morning via her Twitter account. Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding, who plays Emily’s husband, Sean, continues: “She is an enigma, my wife. You can get close to her, but never quite reach her.”

As quick flashes of police sirens, a violent car crash, and deliciously smirky glances flash onscreen, Emily reminds us: “Everybody has a dark side. Some of us are better at hiding it than others.”

The biggest reveal the trailer presents, however, is Emily grinning in a crimson wig after Stephanie explains: “Five days ago, Emily went missing. I’m realizing I don’t know her as well as I thought I did. Emily, if you’re out there, we’re all really worried!”

In anticipation of the trailer’s release, Lively sent fans into a tizzy Monday by deleting all of her Instagram posts save for a single photo of a hangman-style game which spelled out the question, “What happened to Emily?” As of Wednesday, Lively unfollowed most of the accounts she previously tracked, and is now following only women named Emily Nelson — 37 of them, to be exact.

A Simple Favor — also starring Rupert Friend, Jean Smart, Linda Cardellini, Andrew Rannells, and Sarah Baker — is set for release on Sept. 14. Watch the film’s trailer above.",fake

But for Victoria Adams, then known as Posh Spice, it turned out to be a key moment in her personal life too.

The video would soon catch the eye of Premier League soccer player David Beckham, who immediately picked out the brunette Spice Girl in her black PVC catsuit and matching gloves.

He declared: “That’s the girl for me and I'm going to get her! She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.”

They later met at a Manchester United soccer players’ lounge, where it was love at first sight—although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.

The couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.

However, it hasn’t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David’s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.

The couple’s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.

David retired from professional soccer in 2013, playing his final game in boots with the names of his wife and children stitched on to them.

He has consistently ranked among the highest earners in the sport. His net worth as of March 2017 is $450 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth—a number which Victoria matches through her own earnings.

If one of the parents are working or tied up in events, then the other will step in and take over or they bring young Stormi to work if possible. ""Although they are Kylie and Travis, they have a very normal life when it comes to parenting. They value their time with her, and also know it's important to get time alone, so the two plan date nights to dinner or movies, or just stay home, and have a family member or friend watch her,"" the source added.

The duo didn’t make their first public appearance together as a couple until the Olivier Awards in London in 2016. Harington opened up about falling in love with Leslie during an interview with L’Uomo Vogue, saying, “If you’re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.”

In June, Harington revealed that he had moved in with Leslie during his appearance on CBS’ The Late Late Show With James Corden.

“I’ve moved in with my other best friend, Rose,” said Harington. “So, I’m very. very happy and it’s going well. She has all sorts of ideas for the house.

""Brad and Angelina stood back at one point and let the kids play. They were smiling and really enjoying the day — you can tell they love watching their kids learn.""

However, Angelina had to spread the love to her ladiez.

(Whoa! We're sure Brad would have loved to join in on that. LOLz!)

The future Mrs. Pitt got a break from her brood as she stepped out for a VDay lunch at Public at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel with four other women and a man.

It sounds like Brad’s VDay gift to her - other than those HIGHlarious mints - might have been an adult-only lunch where she didn’t have to cut food up for the kids or wipe their mouths off. A source revealed:

“[She] seemed really comfortable and totally peaceful. Just having a nice lunch.”

Awww!

Luckily, Brad got his love back in time for dinner, which we're guessing was pretty romantic, loving and damn hot.

Taylor Swift's Reputation has just surpassed two million sales, making it the first album to do so since Adele's 25 in 2015.

Currently in its 18th week of release, it's also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran's ÷ being the other, according to Nielsen tracking figures. Reputation hit the milestone in its first week of release, selling 1.2 million copies.

All of Swift's six previous studio albums - 1989, Red, Speak Now, Fearless, and Taylor Swift - sold more than two million copies.

However, Forbes pointed out that, interestingly, it took significantly longer for Reputation to hit that phenomenal milestone. In fact, longer than Swift's past three albums combined.

2014's 1989 hit 2 million during its third week of release, 2012's Red during its fifth week of release, and 2010's Speak Now during its sixth week. Even 2008's Fearless took only seven weeks to pass 2 million sales.

Swift’s 50-plus-stop stadium tour will commence on 8 May. She recently released the video for her new single ""Delicate"", which imagined the musician gaining the power of invisibility, allowing her a brief sojourn away from her much-tormenting ""reputation"".

-2526708994,Angelina Jolie & Jared Leto Dating After Brad Pitt Divorce — Report,"REX Shutterstock

Say what?! A wild new report claims that newly single Angelina Jolie is ‘getting close’ with none other than Hollywood bachelor, Jared Leto. OMG!

Did Angelina Jolie, 41, trade ex Brad Pitt, 53, in for a slightly younger model? It’s hard to believe anyone would want to pass on Brad, but Star magazine is reporting that Angelina is cozying up to Jared Leto, 45. Whoa!

“There has always been a spark between them,” a source told the magazine inside their February 27 issue. “Now, during these tough times for Angie, it seems Jared has helped her cope and even brought her out of her funk. They’re kindred, unconventional spirits — so much so that I think Jared could be the perfect guy for Angie if she’s ever ready for a new love in her life.”

That is some seriously heavy romance talk. The sources added that Angelina and Jared have shared some “secret” time together since it was revealed she would be divorcing Brad. Even better? “Jared reached out to Angie after she filed divorce papers in September,” an insider claimed. “The word is they spoke several times on the phone before meeting up in L.A. for dinner, and they’ve been seeing each other whenever they can since then.”

If you’re wondering how Jared and Angie would even know each other, they’ve co-starred in two films together over the years. The first was 1999’s Girl, Interrupted, and the second was 2004’s Alexander. Interestingly, Jared has also worked with Brad, as they co-starred in 1999’s Fight Club. Small world, right?

Tell us, HollywoodLifers — Do YOU think Angie and Jared would make a cute couple? Comment below with your thoughts!

-2500579008,Ariel Winter's Fake Baby Voice Will Make You Instantly Uncomfortable,"Everyone has at least one weird, useless talent (think rolling your tongue or being able to lick your elbow).

Ariel Winter's secret weird talent is actually kind of creepy and freaks everyone who witnesses it out: She can do a really high-pitched baby voice.

While promoting Smurfs: The Lost Village, Ariel revealed that unlike most of her previous animated voice work, she got to use her real voice instead of a fake one. That's when she clued everyone watching into the fact that she's actually a pro at doing voices, and her fake baby voice is one that her boyfriend and her friends would rather her not do.

Why? you ask. Well, because her baby voice isn't cute and cuddly like in an episode of Peppa Pig. No, it's straightup terrifying. Like straight out of Chucky.

Check it out below and get ready to criiiiiiinge.

At least in Ariel's case, her fake voice skills pay off… literally. She gets paid big bucks to use them in movies, so more power to her!",fake

Oops! Jessica Simpson, 36, had a little mishap leaving her husband Eric Johnson‘s 38th birthday party on September 19. The couple, who have been married for three years, were spotted leaving posh Los Angeles hotspot Craig’s in the wee hours of September 20 after what appeared to be an absolute banger of a bash. As paparazzi surrounded the couple, the fashion mogul had a bit of trouble getting around the cameramen. She missed a curb while wearing sky-high heels and nearly fell to the ground!

Good thing Eric was by her side and holding her hand! He caught her when she stumbled and saved the day, pulling her upright. Whew! She was totally fine, by the way. Eric clearly thought the whole thing was hilarious. He was cracking up after seeing the unintentionally goofy Jessica was pulling as she went down. You gotta admit — there’s nothing funnier than people tripping and falling. It’s just a fact of life.

Jessica was a good sport about the incident, too, sticking out her tongue at the paps as she hopped in her car. Take that! Eric’s definitely having the best birthday ever. At another birthday party for the athlete three days prior, Jessica got low while wearing a beer wench costume and totally flashed her butt to everyone at the beer garden. She was only wearing a black thong underneath the flouncy skirt. She captioned the pic “38 IS GREAT 🍻#IAMSOHOTFORYOU” on Instagram. Damn! Eric looked absolutely thrilled at the situation, stretching out his arms like her won a championship with a beer stein in each hand. Happy birthday, dude!

Courteney Cox, 53, has been by her good friend Jennifer Aniston‘s side through her ups and downs and now that Jen is separated from husband Justin Theroux, 46, Courteney wants to make sure she doesn’t go back to Brad Pitt, 54. “Courteney immediately reached out to Jennifer urging her to leave Brad in the past after hearing rumors that Jen may be rekindling things with her ex,” a source close to Courteney EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “Courteney was with Jen through it all with Brad and with Justin too. Through good times and the bad, Courteney has helped Jen through relationship issues over the years and she still feels very protective of her friend.”

Now that Jen is single, Courteney wants her to get a fresh start and not go back to something that already ended badly. “Courteney pressured Jen as she issued a stern warning, move forward and find someone new,” the source continued. “Courteney‘s warning made it clear to Jen that friendly conversation with Brad may be, ‘OK,’ but she better not jump back in bed with him just because she is feeling weak or is going through a tough breakup!”

Courteney’s concern for Jen may be appropriate since there’s been reports that Jen and Brad have been talking regularly ever since her split from Justin. After a highly public marriage and split, the former lovebirds are used to being in the spotlight both professionally and personally.

Since their divorce in July 2015, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert have managed to keep from crossing paths. Even though they've attended some of the same functions, the former couple has reportedly avoided meeting face-to-face since their split.

But according to some reports, Shelton and Lambert recently reunited, with one outlet claiming it was more than just a friendly meeting. The site claims that ""the bad boy crooner had a secret rendezvous with ex-wife Miranda Lambert and poured out his heart about how much he missed her.""

The same report says ""insiders"" revealed that Shelton and Lambert got ""cozy"" during a gala in Nashville, and that he even complimented her on her new single, ""Vice."" According to the report, Shelton's current girlfriend Gwen Stefani is not happy about his secret meeting with Lambert.

In recent days, more than one outlet has published reports claiming that Shelton and Lambert reunited. So is there any truth to the rumors?

It turns out the rumors are simply that, rumors. A contact close to Shelton and Lambert got in touch with Gossip Cop, a website known for exclusively debunking rumors and falsified reports in the entertainment industry. The contact confirmed to Gossip Cop that the supposed meeting between Shelton and Lambert is ""completely made up.""

In addition, Shelton hasn't even been in Nashville since August, likely due to his commitments for The Voice. Although Shelton and Lambert were both at the ACM Honors in August, they never encountered one another at the event.

While Shelton is completely devoted to The Voice right now, Lambert is preparing for the release of a double album. Called The Weight of These Wings, the album will make its debut on November 18th.

The reported breakup was amicable, but obviously Natalia’s hurt. To make it sting worse, she thinks Charlie’s allegedly rubbing it in her face by very publicly partying and having fun without her. “Partying with his sister [has] been a kick in the teeth for Natalia,” the source said. “She’s basically been pushed aside without a second thought.”

Breakups are always awful, but if Natalia and Charlie did split, it’s going to be extra awkward. The two actors play lovebirds and partners in ass-kicking Jonathan and Nancy on Stranger Things.

-2365987922,Jennifer Lopez's secret to staying youthful is a mantra embroidered on her pillowcase,"Jenny and her silk pillowcases.

It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.

Dramatic? Not even close.

And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.

Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.

So what is this magic phrase?

“I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”

Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”

Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.

The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”

And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.

So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.",fake

USA TODAY

It would appear the Big Bang Theory's Kaley Cuoco is dipping her riding boot-encased-toe back into the dating pool.

On Friday, the 30-year-old actress posted a shot to Instagram showing her snuggling with Karl Cook, a fellow equestrian, captioned, ""This is what happy looks like.""

Cook, a 25-year-old up-and-coming pro rider who specializes in show jumping, began showing up her Instagram feed a few weeks ago.

But she hasn't forgotten her first love, Santos, her own show-jumping mount:

From a distance, the choice of a barn-friendly boyfriend is a wise first step after her divorce from tennis pro Ryan Sweeting. Cuoco and Cook have a major passion in common. Plus, the horse people know it never hurts to have someone who can pitch in with stall duty when you're away.

And who doesn't enjoy a man who looks good in riding breeches?",fake

An insider close to the The Weeknd revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the “Starboy” singer is very interested in making babies with the “Fetish” songstress when the time comes!

“He has thought about starting a family with Selena at some point down the line, maybe in a few years and he has told her that he would want to have a girl because nothing would be better for him then to have a cute little Selena look-alike bouncing around,” the source said said. “He’s mentioned to her many times that two of her would always be better than one.”

We cannot imagine two people who would make a cuter baby than Sel and The Weeknd and we really hope that if they keeping on loving each other, they get to the baby making stage one day! Right now they are both busy with their music careers and touring, and of course still growing and learning more about each other every day.

Among the many topics discussed between host and ex-sex tape star, of course, was the dishonesty and infidelity of Tristan Thompson.

As previously cited, Kardashian said simply that Thompson cheating on sister Khloe Kardashian was just so ""f-cked up,"" a term she apologized for using on air.

But an appropriate term nonetheless, right?

Elsewhere in this sit-down, Kim described the entire situation as ""sad,"" while not exactly answering Ellen directly when asked if she EVER liked Thompson.

Instead, she rambled on about how Khloe often ""dives in"" to romances and the family supports her as best they can.

Interesting, right?

As for other subjects touched on in this semi-revealing Q&A?

Kim wanted to initially name her third child Jo or Grace.

Kanye played the game Connect 4 during Chicago’s delivery. (In his defense, Kim was not the one doing the delivering; they used a surrogate.)

""The second she came out, any fear that I had of, ‘Will I not have this connection? Will she not look like me?’ all of that goes out the door, and instantly, she’s ours,"" Kim of watching a surrogate birth Chicago.

""It’s such a good feeling.""

Saint has an ""amazing vocabulary"" and may be a genius.

North has been ""better"" with Chicago than she was with Saint when he was first born but that Saint is still the ""nicer"" one.""

Yes, despite photo evidence to the contrary at times, Kanye West is a happy person.

As for Kim’s extended feelings on Thompson, both now and even before this scandal hit?

Despite the smiles and laughs that the co-parents flashed on the red carpet, there was an ugly dispute taking place underneath.

But, a source told OK! exclusively that Mariah and Nick, who put on a united front around the cameras, were not as happy once inside. The two “apparently had an argument of some sort while they were sitting in their seats.” And while it’s unclear what they disagreed on, it didn’t seem to blow over, as “she got up and left and Nick went over to her manager and grabbed his kids,” continued the insider. And Mariah didn’t return to her seat!

What the hell could Nick and Mariah POSSIBLY be beefing about, in front of their children, at the Kids’ Choice Awards???

The obvious answer might seem to be the fugly orange outfits that Nick had Morrocan were rockin’, but chances are it was something much deeper.

But was it really THAT bad that Nick had to take the kids away from a show that was for them? SMH.

12:01 PM PT -- The judge just sided with Tran ... ordering the restraining order stay in place for the next 5 years.

Chris Brown threatened violence against his ex-GF after they broke up, demanding she give back money and gifts he had given her during their relationship ... this according to Karrueche Tran's in-person testimony in court.

Karrueche took the stand Thursday in her restraining order case against Chris, telling a judge after she broke up with the singer ... he demanded diamond rings he bought for her to be returned. When she refused ... Karrueche says Chris became aggressive.

Karrueche explained that in text messages between herself and Chris post-breakup, he would say things like ""I'm not being nice to you no more, if I see you out in public again and I'm there I will make you hate me even more, don't be anywhere I'm out in public, I'm going to ban you from all events.""

She claims he also texted her more violent threats like ... ""I can get my money back and I'm tired of playing games"" as well as ""Bitch I will beat the s**t out of you"" and ""I promise you I will make your life hell."" She says he also once wrote ""Imma kill blood"" under a photo of her and actor Michael B. Jordan.

Karrueche also testified that Chris had beaten her before.

Chris Brown's attorney, David Gammill, grilled Karrueche on cross-examination, and pressed her on allegedly taunting Chris about the rings by saying she had sold them. Karrueche told Gammill she never planned to return the rings because they were hers. Gammill also brought up the point of Karrueche never reporting any of the alleged behavior to authorities.",fake

This weekend, Bullock will star “Ocean’s 8,” the all-female reboot of “Ocean’s 11” and Bullock’s first starring role since 2015’s “Our Brand Is Crisis.” Early tracking has its opening weekend set at roughly $30 million.

Bullock told USA Today that in her early career, beginning with her breakout role in 1994’s “Speed,” she had little idea of what women have had to face in this industry. “My career has been a domino effect of people who said, ‘I would like this person to fill this role,’” she continued. “I literally went out into the world thinking there was no disparity, that everyone was equal, and I can do whatever a man can do.”

However, Bullock said that later in her career is when she had a “wake-up moment,” though she wouldn’t get into any specifics about the sexism she experienced. She said it had a lasting effect on her.

“‘What is this feeling? Why do I feel so (expletive)?’” she said. “‘Oh my God, I’m being treated this way because I have a vagina.’”

Kate Upton, 25, is doing a great job supporting her fiancée Justin Verlander, 34, during the World Series. The Houston Astros pitcher has led the team all the way to the sixth game in the series, and it’s entirely possible that they could win it all. While Kate has been supportive on the sidelines, she’s also reportedly been bringing her encouragement all the way to home base. We’ve learned EXCLUSIVELY that the model has been utilizing some sexy ensembles to help Justin unwind. See pics of the couple here!

“Justin loves lingerie so Kate has brought 7 drop dead sexy time outfits to help inspire him during the series. She’s been wearing one per night to keep him happy and relaxed,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “The last thing he needs is to be getting stressed out. Now he’s pitching in game six and could win the whole thing on Halloween. It’s the biggest game of his life and she knows it. She’s doing everything she can to help him prepare and promises a huge romantic celebration if Justin and the Astros win the World Series on Halloween.”

While Kate has been showing off in the bedroom, it seems that it doesn’t go beyond the seven sexy style choices. “No sex on game day is the rule in the Verlander home,” a source close to Kate Upton previously told us. “This is Justin’s philosophy. Kate would never refuse sex with her man Justin. She loves him and they have explosive chemistry together.” This backs up what Kate said about Justin’s game day prep back in February.“There’s no sex before a game. Absolutely none,” she said, according to the New York Post. “What I’ve [also] just found out is, if he plays too well, there’s no sex after, either. What a buzzkill for me!” We admire Justin’s commitment to his craft and we’re sure Kate probably has the perfect plan for how to celebrate if his team wins the World Series on Oct. 31.

‘It’s over,’ one insider told the US publication. ‘She’s realised he’s not the man she fell in love with.’

According to the bombshell report, the final straw was an ugly fight that erupted after Kanye’s recent off-the-wall tweets, including support of Donald Trump and referring to slavery as a ‘choice’.

‘She called him out on his selfishness and how he doesn’t ever think of the repercussions it could have for her brands,’ an insider explosively tells. ‘All he cares about is his music and clothing line.’

‘It was one of their worst fights ever.’

The source outrageously adds that Kim is petrified to divorce a third time and potentially fight with Kanye over their shared $300 million fortune, but her desire to get out ‘is greater than’ her fear.

‘Kim wants her old life back,’ a source said.

In Touch further claims that Kim has had enough of Kanye’s erratic behaviour.

‘Kim is a nervous wreck because she never knows what’s around the corner when it comes to his actions,’ a Kardashian insider said.

‘She just can’t take it anymore and stays at Kris’ house with the kids.’

-2303457681,"Shannen Doherty on Charmed reboot's 'terrible, offensive' description","Shannen Doherty is weighing in on The CW’s reboot of her fan favorite hit series Charmed.

The actress had a flurry of thoughts on the topic over the weekend while chatting with fans on Twitter. Doherty’s opinion is nuanced and complex; she isn’t simply pro- or anti-reboot. Based on her tweets, she’s intrigued and curious about the new project, and doesn’t want to be negative about it — she even defends the idea of a reboot in general — yet strongly agrees with some fans who object to the network’s description of the project as “feminist reboot” of the original series (when the 1998-2006 series was considered feminist too).

Getty Images

First, on the very idea of a reboot:

And notes that it will mean more lead roles for women…

Likewise, while some have slammed the idea of bringing back Charmed as unoriginal, The WB series actually followed 1996’s similarly premised film The Craft and the 1995 book Practical Magic (which released a film version the same year Charmed hit the air). So at one point, the original Charmed was likewise considered by some to be a knock-off…

And Doherty would rather not be negative about it…

BUT … that official description though … (which described the new series this way: “This fierce, funny, feminist reboot of the original series centers on three sisters in a college town who discover they are witches. Between vanquishing supernatural demons, tearing down the patriarchy, and maintaining familial bonds, a witch’s work is never done”).

Also, the reboot’s new cast better have different character names…

Oh, and in case you’re wondering what Doherty is watching lately:

Previously, co-star Holly Marie Combs had her turn to weigh in on the Charmed reboot.

However, Angelina's participation in the project is still up in the air.

While her character died in the first installment of the film, Bekmambetov told MTV that he would bring her back in some capacity, in the sequel.

Only problem is A.J. reportedly backed out of the film. We hear details (aka money and exactly how much time she'd need to give to the flick) were never worked out, which is why Angelina is out, for now—but she could possibly make a cameo if the film actually happens.

So can Kristen save the franchise?

Kristen is set to start filming Breaking Dawn possibly as early as October, while the Wanted follow-up was originally slated to start shooting around the end of August.

“Angelina knew Jared was a sore spot with Brad, so anytime she wanted to push his buttons she’d bring up Jared and talked about how much she loved working with him and how talented he is,” the insider continued. “She even sent him a script behind Brad’s back a couple of years ago.” Whoa! That definitely doesn’t sound good.

Another insider previously told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Brad really wouldn’t be “shocked” if his estranged wife was dating Jared as he’s always known about her “crush.” Brad and Angelina split in September 2016 when she filed for divorce and it was only recently that rumors of a relationship between her and Jared started up.

“Jared reached out to Angie after she filed divorce papers in September,” an insider told Star in the magazine’s Feb. 27 issue. “The word is they spoke several times on the phone before meeting up in L.A. for dinner, and they’ve been seeing each other whenever they can since then.” If they are together now it seems like Brad may have been right about Angie’s “crush”!

Is that a way for the rapper to tell his loyal followers that he will be running for president?

We have learned that the man is currently doing some serious renovations at his and Kim K’s huge mansion in California.

We all know that the rapper has a massive ego, but that is not even equaled by the size of his bank accounts.

That being said, sources have told us that Kanye called in a team and asked them to build an Oval Office just for him at home, because why not?

As for the interior design of the office, while it will pretty much replicate the original White House one, the vibe will be different.

Kanye West’s Oval Office will be less ‘stuffy’ looking and will channel more of the rapper’s personality and his expensive taste.

As fans may already be aware, Kanye and Kim’s relationship hasn’t been the best lately, and insiders claim they are sleeping in separate beds.

Katie Holmes' people have dismissed 'untrue' rumours that she has split with long-term partner Jamie Foxx.

A representative told People: 'The Radar story is 100 percent untrue.'

The tabloid story in question alleged that Holmes and the Oscar-winning actor had been planning a wedding, but called it off and then split due to 'trust issues'.

The very private couple have been dating since 2013, after they were spotted dancing together at the Hamptons a year after the Dawson Creek star's highly-publicised separation from Tom Cruise.

The pair have avoided attending events where they might be photographed together, but did sit next to each other at at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala earlier this year in January. Holmes, 38, and Foxx, 50, looked very happy together - and just look at the way the actress is gazing at her boyfriend.

Takes us right back to the royal wedding...

Holmes also helped the actor celebrated his recent 50th, and the duo were seen arriving together at Paramount Pictures for his party.

Speaking previously about keeping his relationships out of the spotlight, he told ET: 'I like to stay quiet, you know, with anyone that dating; that I'm really, really dating.

'I feel like this... if there's somebody that you're dating, the worst thing you can do is let that [points at camera] touch you. Because once that camera touches you, [it's out]. ... Yeah, we don't take time to do that [make sure the relationship is real] in Hollywood anymore.'",fake

Most stars reacted with a mixture of anger, ridicule, skepticism and sarcasm.

""This 2 hour live broadcast of the new Purge film on all of network TV is very bold,"" Josh Gad mocked.

Late-night comedians teed up their jokes early. Jimmy Kimmel watched the speech with Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who was reportedly paid to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. She was a guest later on his show ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""

Stephen Colbert also tweeted during the speech.

Some celebrities praised Trump's speech, however.

Conservative commentator Ann Coulter said it was ""beautifully delivered,"" while Chuck Woolery said it was filled with ""new hope.""

Kanye West usually loves having all the attention on him, but sometimes he just doesn’t want his name in the midst of the madness.

The G.O.O.D music CEO is being used by a rapper trying to get his come-up by bashing Donald Trump and forging Kanye’s participation in his music. TMZ reports that King Myers dropped a track called “Propaganda” and put ‘Ye’s name on it as producer. He even used Kanye’s Twitter avatar as his cover art, leading people to believe that the famous rapper had some involvement.

However, Kanye’s team is speaking out about the fraudulent project, saying that West has nothing to do with it, and he’s already put his lawyers on the job to get his name and art removed from the track.

The news of a fake Trump diss by Kanye comes just after reports that ‘Ye deleted all of his pro-Trump tweets from Twitter. Maybe he and President Trump aren’t such long-time friends after all.

They have a pretty great relationship and they both plan on being with each other forever, so why not start forever sooner than later.” The pair have been together since November 2016, and have proved they are the most normal couple in Hollywood — grocery shopping, walking dogs and support each other in their careers!

Ariel is preparing to film the final season of Modern Family, which she has starred in since 2009. Levi, on the other hand, just celebrated the opening of his film with Gabrielle Union, Breaking In.

Never say never! Gwen Stefani may have thought her pregnancy days were behind her, but she’s considering having one more baby to make Blake Shelton a dad. HollywoodLife.com has the EXCLUSIVE details on how she’s been inspired by late-in-life mom Janet Jackson.

Age is nothing but a number when it comes to having a baby these days. Janet Jackson just proved miracles can happen by giving birth to a healthy son despite being 50-years-old. That has 47-year-old Gwen Stefani inspired to make her boyfriend Blake Shelton, 40, a first time dad. “Gwen would love to have another child with Blake. He’s not pressuring her at all, but she knows it’s something he would love too,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

“She isn’t focused on it obsessively, but seeing Janet Jackson have a healthy baby at 50 has inspired her to open her mind more to the possibility. It’s made her start to see it as something she and Blake really could make happen,” our insider adds. Gwen is already mom to three boys, Kingston, 10, eight-year-old Zuma and her littlest one Apollo, three. She’s made it known big time over the years how it would be a dream come true to have a little girl, so this could be the perfect chance!

The singer reminded us all why she really wants a daughter on The Voice Apr. 18 when commenting on her only female team member Brennley Brown. After the adorable teenage country singer performed “Fly” by Maddie & Tae, Gwen declared, “All I wanted was a little girl I could hang out with and play dress up with and — she’s my only girl and look at her!” Awww. It’s just so wrong that she never had a little mini-me that she could do all sorts of fun girly-girl activities with. We can only imagine how doting a daddy Blake would be to an adorable daughter with Gwen!

They reportedly have been thinking about marriage, but if Tristan has not been on the same page as Khloe then it would definitely create friction.

Khloe has reportedly been trying to support Tristan as he goes into the NBA playoffs with the Cleveland Cavaliers. “He’s just really focused on his game right now, which she’s totally behind,” a source previously revealed to HollywoodLife. “She really supports him, and knows he’s got to go full out while he can.” Tristan reportedly been putting his priority on his basketball dreams. “Tristan’s career is everything to him, and that’s got to be his priority as he only gets one shot at it. Tristan’s career is everything to him, and that’s got to be his priority as he only gets one shot at it,” the insider explained.

The model, 25, was spotted in New York City over the weekend with Christie Brinkley‘s 22-year-old, son Jack Brinkley-Cook. On Thursday, the pair were photographed spending a casual day together.

Agdal and DiCaprio, who made his first public outing since the breakup at the Cannes Film Festival in May, had dated for a year after first being spotted at a New York City club in May 2016. Following their split, a source close to the actor told PEOPLE that he just wasn’t ready to take the next step.

“Leo thought Nina was a super cool girl,” said the source. “It almost seemed different this time because he was way more affectionate and public with her than he normally is, but his friends knew it wouldn’t last.”

The “Dinero” singer stopped by KTU’s Cubby and Carolina Bermudez radio show on Tuesday morning and confirmed there has been no proposal from her former MLB star beau … and there hasn’t been a secret ceremony either.

“I’m not engaged. I’m not engaged. No, no,” she said.

Rumors began swirling when JLo sported what some say looked like an engagement ring on that finger over July 4th weekend, but as The Blast exclusively reported, no engagement went down.

She continued to wear the ring on her wedding finger though, even displaying it this AM.

When asked by the hosts if they ran off to tie the knot, she jokingly screamed, “NO!”

And while no engagement or ceremony has happened for the couple of over a year, JLo couldn’t stop gushing about her relationship with A-Rod.

“I think maybe if we would have met in our twenties, maybe not so much … we were both … we’re too crazy,” JLo said. “But now at this point in our lives, where we both have kids, we both have accomplished certain things in our careers and we’re kinda in that second act of our lives, we really complement each other.”

She added, “Where I need help, he’s really strong and where he needs help, I’m really strong. When two people kind of just fit together really well, he and I are like that.”

When it comes to the kids, JLo says all four are amazing. “I mean, of course I’m going to say that cause I’m their mom, but they are and they’re sweet and they’re loving and they deal with us and our lifestyle in such a great way,” she said, referring to her twins and A-Rod’s daughters, whom she just spent her birthday weekend with.

“I’ve had other relationships where it’s been tricky but with these four it really works nicely,” she added.

-2036408420,"Wiktionary, the free dictionary","Thus Mill’s case for the claim that happiness is the sole human end, put more carefully, is this: ‘Whatever is desired otherwise than as a means to some end beyond itself, and ultimately to happiness, is desired as itself a part of happiness, and is not desired for itself until has become so’ (1861a: 237). Nothing here assumed Hume’s view that every action must ultimately flow from an underived desire. That is a quite separate issue, and Mill’s view of it is closer to that of Kant or Reid than to that of Hume. He insists ‘positively and emphatically’ that the will is a different thing from desire; that a person of confirmed virtue, or any other person whose purposes are fixed, carries out his purposes without any thought of the pleasure he has in contemplating them, or expects to derive from their fulfilment. (1861a: 238) This distinction between purpose and desire is central to Mill’s conception of the will. When we develop purposes we can will against mere likings or aversions: ‘In the case of an habitual purpose, instead of willing the thing because we desire it, we often desire it only because we will it’ (1861a: 238). Every action is caused by a motive, but not every motive is a liking or aversion: When the will is said to be determined by motives, a motive does not mean always, or solely, the anticipation of a pleasure or of a pain…. A habit of willing is commonly called a purpose; and among the causes of our volitions, and of the actions which flow from them, must be reckoned not only likings and aversions, but also purposes. (1843: 842) The formation of purposes from desires is the evolution of will; it is also the development of character. Mill quotes Novalis: ‘a character is a completely fashioned will’ (1843: 843).",fake

-2065033867,Report That Blake Shelton Will Propose To Gwen Stefani On Valentine’s Day Is Untrue [Debunked],"A report alleging that Blake Shelton will pop the question to Gwen Stefani with an expensive engagement ring on Valentine’s Day is untrue. The rumor was started by Hollywood Life on Monday when it claimed The Voice judge had been shopping for a $500,000 diamond ring to have when he asks his lady love to marry him. As an insider told the website, one of Shelton’s assistants had recently been shopping with a private jeweler in Beverly Hills. The source surmised that the timing indicates that Blake is planning to ask Gwen to marry him on Valentine’s Day.

Hollywood Life‘s report added that Gwen Stefani can expect some “serious bling” from Blake Shelton when he finally does pick the right ring.

Gossip Cop squashed the rumor hours after the article was published. It had readers take into consideration that the tabloid also claimed Shelton and Stefani had already gotten engaged and even “secretly married.” The celebrity surveillance website revealed that they were informed by reliable sources a long time ago that no sources close to Blake or Gwen share details with Hollywood Life.

GP corrected another fabricated story just days before about Blake and Gwen after Celebrity Insider reported that the couple is having a “miracle baby.” The report cited a made-up report from OK! magazine that alleged the pair were celebrating two big changes in their lives — their new baby and just getting married at Stefani’s Beverly Hills home in the backyard. It went on to report that Stefani conceived after several IVF treatments.

Photos from Blake and Gwen’s getaway in Playa del Carmen, Mexico didn’t reveal any signs that they’re expecting a baby. Stefani wore a black bikini and showed no obvious physical changes for being a few months pregnant. Moreover, she was strolling on the beach with a drink in her hand.

The couple seems to be doing great with things just the way they are. The two music stars flew to the Super Bowl with Gwen’s three children in tow — Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 3.

Life & Style can exclusively reveal that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux — who tied the knot in August 2015 after several years of dating — are clashing over living in the big NYC.

“Jen loves Justin, but she just doesn’t want to live in the Big Apple any more than she has to,” said a source, adding the Friends alum has “given NYC her best

shot.” The Leftovers star is a big apple boy, and they originally agreed that Jen would spend her time there with him when she wasn’t filming. Fortunately, the source continued, “They’re trying to work it out.”

Fans may be somewhat shocked by this, considering last month Life & Style revealed the Wanderlust co-stars had a case of baby fever. An eyewitness spotted them at Emilio’s Ballato in NYC and recalled, “When I picked up my son, Justin pointed at him and motioned to Jen, and she turned around to smile at him. They seemed to be so smitten at the sight of children.” We certainly hope they can work things out — because we’d love to see them become parents together!

This comes on the heels of reports that Jen reconnected with her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, after splitting in 2005 when he met Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith. “Brad wouldn’t dream of breaking up Jen’s marriage,” a source told In Touch last month. “Brad’s leaning on her as a confidante now.

When it comes to Olivia Munn it's ""sisters before misters."" The model and actress took to Instagram shutting down rumors that she's dating her friend Jennifer Aniston's ex-husband, Justin Theroux.

Posting a screenshot of a conversation with her publicist, Munn was stunned to find that a publication was preparing a story about her rumored relationship with Theroux.

Setting the record straight, Munn flat out denied the rumors.

She didn't stop there. Olivia Munn went on to upload a message for publications constantly including her in ridiculous relationship rumors.

Jen and Brad reconciling would be the stuff of dreams.

Despite rumours circulating, Jennifer’s reps have shot down any hope of a reunion, and have denied that Brad has been in touch.

And sources close to Brad have said the actor hasn’t been in touch with his former wife whatsoever, even to wish his commiserations, although he is ‘sad’ about Jen’s marriage breakdown.

‘Brad is of course sad to hear the news about Jen’s divorce. He only wishes the best for her… However, Brad hasn’t reached out to Jen, and has no plans to do so at this point,’ the source reasoned to Us Weekly.

And Jen’s team denied rumours that Brad is being ‘a shoulder to cry on,’ calling them ‘another fabrication,’ so for now, rumours have been put to bed.

Right?

Brad and Jen are kind of buried history anyway. They were an item between 2000 and 2005 but Brad has spoken out harshly about their relationship in the past; he once controversially called that time of his life ‘pathetic’ in an interview with Parade magazine.

‘It became very clear to me that I was so intent on trying to find a movie about an interesting life, but I wasn’t living an interesting life myself.’

‘I think my marriage [to Aniston] had something to do with it: trying to pretend the marriage was something that it wasn’t,’ he said in 2011.

Jennifer and Justin Therou called time on their marriage this February. They had been married for two years and together since 2011.

Earlier this year, it was confirmed that George and Amal were expecting twins, which British tabloids reported to be a boy and a girl. George wants to make sure the twins enter the world in the most royal manner possible.

According to entertainment portal Aceshowbiz.com, the Hollywood star has rented out the entire Kensington Wing at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, which essentially comes down to $580,000 for a week's stay. Amal is also apparently flying in two 'birth companions' from Los Angeles for around $30,000. George also wants Amal to be completely relaxed during the birth, which is why he hired an Italian masseuse for the hotshot lawyer for $5,000.

We must admit, we were a little surprised when we heard that Blac Chyna, 29, may have signed a record contract. However, her ex Rob Kardashian, 30, was a million times more shocked! But the more he thinks about it, the more hilarious he thinks it is. Click here to see pics of Rob and Blac’s final blowout fight.

“Rob has had some major laughs thinking about Blac Chyna trying to rap,” an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “And even if she goes after Rob in her raps he thinks she will be so bad that it won’t matter because she will just be embarrassing herself. He is actually kind of looking forward to see her fail and thinks she will be even worse than K-Fed.” Yikes! We all remember the cringe-worthy song by Britney Spears’ ex Kevin Federline, “Popozao.” The world doesn’t need a repeat of THAT atrocity.

The reason rumors exploded that Blac would be trying her hand at the rap game is because she was spotted walking into Capital Records with her lawyer, and MTO reports that they offered her a $1 million recording deal. Perhaps she’s become inspired by her pal Nicki Minaj, who recently rapped about her on the track “Rake It Up,” and even invited her to be in the music video!

-1893175436,CONFIRMED: Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston – ‘They’re back on!’,"It’s the sensational magazine cover that has all of America talking! This week’s Star magazine in the US features the news that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are ‘back together’ with the help of George Clooney – seemingly confirming New Idea’s exclusive report last week that he had engineered the couple’s reunion.

According to Star, when Angelina Jolie left Brad’s life, party-loving George was excited to return, having allegedly been shunted out of the actor’s life by a disapproving Ange. And he reportedly relished the opportunity to facilitate a thawing between Brad and his ex-wife Jen.

‘They’ve been secretly getting together for late night hook ups, and it’s all because of George,’ a source told Star.

‘George was the first person to call him when his marriage to Angie imploded. After Jen and Justin Theroux announced their split, he encouraged Brad to reach out and give their relationship another chance.’

According to the magazine, the duo had their first post-slip meet up an March 3 at a private pre-Oscars party in Beverly Hills.

‘The plan was to head over to Jen’s place afterward for a nightcap, but, of course, George would just drop Brad off.’

The magazine claims that Jen was so excited by the idea, that she even went to the extreme of lending George her bodyguard so he could drive the pair to her home.

‘Their evening together was very relaxed and low-key,’ the source told Star. ‘They reminisced about the past and had a lot of laughs. It seems just like old times, only better.’

While Star notes that George Clooney’s rep had denied their story, the magazine goes on to note that Jennifer ‘wants to keep the reunion under the radar’, given that she only announced her marriage split weeks ago.

The divorce news follows reports that Pitt has made some positive changes in his life since his dramatic split from Jolie. As People noted last month, ""Brad seems to be in a better place.

“The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated,” she writes in the memoir, according to RadarOnline, calling the decision to undergo the surgery “complex.”

Jenner says she decided to be open about the surgery in order to stop the questions and inquiries about when — or if — she would have it done.

“I am telling you because I believe in candor,” she says. “So all of you can stop staring. You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.”

A source told Touch Weekly that the 48-year-old actress' husband Justin Theroux was trying his best to uplift her spirits, but it is the Allied actor who ""understands her better than anyone else"".

The report claimed that Pitt was Aniston's only hope as he was around when her relationship with her mother turned sour. Reports suggest that the mother-daughter duo's bond worsened after Dow published a tell-all book titled From Mother And Daughter to Friends: A Memoir in 1999.

""Brad knows the history of Jen's complicated relationship with Nancy and doesn't judge her for the feelings she's having,"" the source was quoted as saying. ""He pointed out that Jen didn't love her mom, and she's mourning the loss of the mother she would never know. Jen was deeply touched and realized he was right.""

The source continued that the new and improved Pitt has been extremely helpful since he first reached out to Aniston following Dow's death.

""Jennifer is so grateful to have him back in her life,"" the source added.

Pitt was earlier pursuing his divorce from former wife Angelina Jolie and was embroiled in a bitter custody for his six children. However, for the sake of their children, the former couple have reportedly started talking directly with one another.

Pitt also reportedly met his children – Shiloh, Maddox, Knox, Vivienne, Zahara and Pax – in Cambodia, where Jolie was filming her new movie titled First They Killed My Father.

It was announced last week that Williams was set to wed her boyfriend, Ricky Van Veen, and now we've gotten a closer look at her dazzling engagement ring! The actress flashed her diamond sparkler for the first time at Sunday's Vanity Fair Oscar party, making for a major red carpet moment.

Williams' cushion-cut ring is seriously stunning—and massive—and appears to be flanked by multiple diamonds on each side.

Thomas Markle told broadcaster ITV on Monday that he had several phone conversations with Harry, including one in which the prince asked for permission to marry his daughter.

Markle said Mr. Trump was discussed at least once: ""Our conversation was I was complaining about not liking Donald Trump, he said 'give Donald Trump a chance'. I sort of disagreed with that.""

Markle said he also asked his future son-in-law about Britain's 2016 decision to leave the European Union and got the impression Harry is comfortable with Brexit.

""I think he was open to the experiment,"" Markle said.

Harry's press office declined to comment on Markle's televised interview, which could raise eyebrows because senior royal figures are scrupulously careful not to comment publicly on domestic or international political affairs.

Markle, who had been scheduled to walk his daughter down the aisle, missed the royal wedding in May due to heart problems. He told ITV he was ""doing much better"" and that he regretted missing the big event.

The 73-year-old Markle, who watched the wedding from California, says he was ""very proud"" but that ""the unfortunate thing for me now is I'm a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history rather than the dad walking her down the aisle.""

""I can't think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles,"" he says of Prince Harry's own father, who walked Meghan most of the way down the aisle on her wedding day. ""He looked very handsome and my daughter looked beautiful with him. I was jealous, I wish I had been there, I wish it'd been me. But thank God he was there and thank him for that.""

He says the couple, now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will probably seek to have children soon.

""She's wanted children for a long time,"" he said.

Markle said he gave Harry permission to marry his daughter over the phone.

""Harry asked for her hand on the phone and I said: 'You are a gentleman, promise me you will never raise your hand against my daughter and of course I will grant you my permission. ""'",fake

All of the bulls— that we do comes from a place of love.”

Jennifer Aniston and Chelsea Handler are thought to no longer be BFFs following a fall out in 2015 but Chelsea is reportedly keen to patch up their friendship.

The split came after Jennifer, 48, found out that Chelsea had allegedly been revealing secrets about the former Friends star’s relationship to her ex-husband Brad Pitt.

According to Radar Online, comedienne Chelsea has now admitted to friends that she was at fault for the pair’s fall out.

‘Chelsea knows that she really messed things up with her.

‘And the worst part is that now Jennifer has turned everyone against her,’ a source revealed.

Radar previously reported that, according to a source, the Along Came Polly star ordered her publicist, Stephen Huvane, to drop Chelsea from his roster, because she was so angry with the star of Chelsea Lately.

‘[Stephen Huvane] dumped Chelsea after she had a huge blowup with Jennifer — one of his very top-priority clients. He’s no longer representing Chelsea.’

Meanwhile it seems that despite her split from Brad Pitt in 2005 – over ten years ago – we just can’t get over their relationship.

In June, reports emerged that Brad Pitt is making amends with his ex-wife, according to Life & Style mag, despite Chelsea saying the actress ‘doesn’t care’ about what is going on with Brad at the time.

If Jelena fans were still holding out hope that there was still a connection between Selena Gomez, 25, and Justin Bieber, 23, the fact that he didn’t know she underwent a top-secret kidney transplant should be proof enough that these two don’t stay in contact. The “Hands To Myself” singer shocked the world when she revealed on Sept. 14 that her best friend Francia Raisa, 29, donated one of her kidneys to Selena after her Lupus condition required the operation earlier this summer. Justin found out just like the rest of her fans via her Instagram post about it because they just don’t talk anymore.

“He is hearing about this just as everyone is hearing about it. He’s he is happy that she is okay, but he has no interest in contacting her to see how she is doing. This will not be a catalyst for them to talk again. He is generally happy she is okay, but that is all he wants to deal with right now when it comes to her,” a source close to the Biebs tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

They’ve both had other relationships. It’s over.” Isn’t that the truth! Selena’s been blissfully happy dating The Weeknd, 27, for nine months now and he was totally her “rock” during the medical crisis. Even though the singer was on tour, he stayed in constant contact to make sure his lady was doing well. Oh man, how stressful that must have been! If these two can make it through something as serious as an organ transplant ordeal, there’s nothing that can break their union.

-1674483293,Justin Bieber’s tour cancellation: ‘I want to be sustainable’,"Justin Bieber has explained to fans why he cancelled the remainder of his Purpose world tour, saying ""I want my mind heart and soul to be sustainable"".

After playing 150 concerts across 40 countries during the world tour, Bieber cancelled the final 14, saying he was ""just resting, getting some relaxation"". In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.

“I’ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,” he wrote. “Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.”

Perhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: ""Learning and growing hasn't always been easy but knowing I'm not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I'm not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes. I wanna be a man that learns from them and grows from them.!!""

He signed off by apologising for any grammatical errors: “I THINK THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS!!”

With the tour now finished, the statement closes a chapter of his career. His album Purpose spawned a series of colossal hit singles, including What Do You Mean, Love Yourself, and Sorry, which until recently was the most streamed song of all time globally. It was replaced by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's Despacito, which Bieber also features on.

But while he played the ever supportive partner for the cameras, later that night, Keith, 49, totally lost his cool.

Onlookers at an Emmy’s after party have revealed exclusively to Woman’s Day details of the couple’s explosive showdown.

Those at the awards celebration say they now fear for the couple’s marriage after what is being described as “a fight to end all fights.”

“Keith had accused Nicole of disrespecting and humiliating him by kissing Alexander in front of everyone,” our insider explains.

“They looked tense as soon as they walked into the after party and it was clear there was something going on despite their initial attempts to put on a united front.”

In Big Little Lies, Nicole and Alexander play a couple in a troubled marriage.

“They’d posed for pictures on the red carpet outside, but they separated as soon as they got inside the party – with Keith going straight to the bar, tucking into the dumplings and pagodas which were being passed around.”

“Meanwhile, Nicole made an instant beeline for Alexander despite Keith already accusing her of blatantly disregarding him.”

Keith looked on as Nic grabbed he co-star’s face and planted a kiss right on his lips.

The night didn’t end well for the couple.

“They were at loggerheads the whole evening and it looked like Nicole was trying to get under Keith’s skin – draping her arms around Alexander and trying to kiss him again, which was incredibly awkward for everyone else in the room.”

“Keith and Nicole then had a heated discussion in the corner of the room, before both storming off relatively early in the proceedings,” our source says.

And we know what you’ve been wondering in the midst of this whole thing – where does Zayn Malik stand on the matter?

Luckily, Zayn has confirmed once and for all whether he’s a member of Team Tay or not, giving his say on all the backlash that Swifty has been facing over her shade-filled new track.

Chatting to The Fader who quizzed him on the Taylor Swift drama, Zayn kept things pretty neutral when he said: ""When it comes to anything that has to do with trivia about people’s personal lives or things that’s going on in their careers, I don’t necessarily pay too much attention.""

Keeping well out of the whole thing, Zayn went on: ""I don’t pay too much attention to what people even say about me. I just tend to take it for what it is when I meet them people in real life and have a conversation with them.

“If they’re cool with me, then I base my relationship on that.""

While Zayn is staying on the fence for theTaylor vs Kimye feud, he did go on to confirm that he has no issues with Swifty herself, who is of course best pals with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid.

""I rate her as an artist, I think she’s cool, I think she’s successful, and I think she deserves her success because she’s worked hard,"" he said.

""That’s just how I look at it. I did a song with her, it was fun, she was professional. She gets on with my girlfriend, they’re good friends.""

""I don’t have a bad word to say about her,"" Zayn added finally. ""She’s cool.""

So that's that, Mr Malik has spoken - and remained in Gigi's good boyfriend books as an extra bonus.

-16254156,Newly Engaged Justin Bieber Still Has His Selena Gomez Tattoo,"Justin Bieber may want to take a trip to his tattoo artist soon.

The 24-year-old singer got engaged to Hailey Baldwin on Saturday, but he still has his tattoo dedicated to his ex-girlfriend -- Selena Gomez -- on his left wrist. On Tuesday, Bieber and Baldwin were snapped together in New York City, where the tattoo -- featuring a girl with long hair, meant to be Gomez -- was still clearly visible.

TheImageDirect.com

TheImageDirect.com

Bieber previously talked about attempting to cover up the tattoo in February 2016. ""This is my ex-girlfriend,"" he told GQ, pointing to the distinct ink. ""So, I tried to cut her face up with some shading, but people still know.""

Clearly, Bieber's tattoos are important to him. Last June, he showed off his ""Better at 70"" tattoo on his leg, which he actually referenced again in his Instagram confirming his engagement to Baldwin.

""My goodness does feel good to have our future secured!"" he wrote of his and Baldwin's engagement. ""WE'RE GONNA BE BETTER AT 70 BABY HERE WE GO!""

Meanwhile, a source previously told ET that 25-year-old Gomez is unbothered by Bieber's engagement. The ""Wolves"" singer was snapped on a relaxing boat cruise with friends in NYC on Sunday after the news broke, and on Tuesday, she stepped out with a huge smile on her face.

Bieber and Gomez rekindled their romance late last year, but cooled off again in March. Before his engagement, he and Selena had been dating on and off since 2010, and even Baldwin appeared to previously be a fan of their longtime romance in now-awkward resurfaced tweets that she's since deleted.

“She does not care at all,” the source said of Gomez's reaction to Bieber's engagement. “What [Bieber and Baldwin] do with their lives does not impact her. Selena is in such a great place and is surrounding herself with good, positive people, and Justin and Hailey’s happiness doesn’t take away from her own happiness.”

“Things just roll off her back now,"" the source added. ""She has a much better perspective on life now that she’s removed herself from the Hollywood bubble.""

However, HollywoodLife has learned EXCLUSIVELY that there’s a reason he’s pushing so hard to keep up with the demanding lifestyle. “Johnny’s 55th birthday is this Saturday [June 9] and, like most of us, he doesn’t like getting older,” a source close to the actor tells us EXCLUSIVELY. “He is accustomed to being adored and has been named Sexiest Man Alive twice, so he likes doing the rockstar thing and living the life he’s always led because he doesn’t feel 55 or want to be 55.”

Our insider says this desire to live the life of an ultimate rockstar may have contributed to the skinny, gaunt look Johnny recently debuted, which has fans concerned about his health. “He wants to be forever young, so he is doing things that make him feel young,” our source adds. “So what we might be seeing is the start of a little bit of a mid-life crisis for him.” As we previously reported EXCLUSIVELY, Johnny is totally unbothered by all the talk surrounding his appearance, as it’s the exact look he’s going for as the frontman of his band.

Still, that hasn’t stopped those close to him from worrying about the effect this rock ‘n roll lifestyle will have on his health and well-being. “He’s partying hard,” another source previously told us. “When Johnny’s single, he doesn’t have anyone to reign him in, and he can get pretty wild when let to his own devices.”",fake

Caitlyn Jenner is the queen of shocking fans and her latest announcement will certainly blow your mind. A new report claims that the reality star is planning on adopting a baby boy!

Caitlyn Jenner, 66, is no doubt loving her new life, but something seems to be missing. The transgender reality star is reportedly expanding her family and is adopting a baby boy. That’s not all. She plans to bring the little one home with the help of another woman!

“She is going to adopt and is leaning toward a little boy,” a source told In Touch. That’s not all. Caitlyn is looking to raise a little one with her bestie Candis Cayne, 44. “Caitlyn and Candis have thought about adopting an older child because there are a lot of trans kids whose parents have turned away, or who have run away from home. But the ideal scenario is a baby. Being a mom is Caitlyn’s dream.” Unfortunately, not everyone in her family is on board with this idea — especially Kris Jenner said the insider. “Caitlyn all of a sudden thinking she can be a mom is beyond belief. Everyone is scratching their heads over this one. Kris says Caitlyn adopting a baby is not only ridiculous but a shameful grab for attention — and Kris knows about getting attention.”

The source also revealed that “Kris is 60 and the last night she would ever want to do again is raise a child. Kris wonders how Caitlyn is going to raise a child now when she barely raised her own kids when she was Bruce — because Bruce wasn’t a hands-on dad unless it involved fun sports stuff.” Well, regardless, we hope Cait continues to help young kids who are struggling with their own transitions. Since coming out as transgender in 2015, Caitlyn has been deemed an important figure in the fight against LGBTQIA rights.

“Nick [Viall] and Vanessa [Grimaldi] never had a chance of actually making it work. They are incredibly different and that was clear from day one. Nick is all about living in LA, being part of the Bachelor scene and making a career in entertainment. That is his focus — not Vanessa,” a source close to the former couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. News of Nick and Vanessa’s split emerged earlier today, more than five months after viewers watched their proposal on The Bachelor finale. And after that finale aired, Nick and Vanessa spent a lot of their time together in LA. But she wasn’t happy about that.

“Vanessa is a extremely driven woman who has her s*** together. She wasn’t going to be happy just being a pseudo celebrity in Hollywood. She’s worked hard at her career and wants to really help people. She’s so incredibly close to her family in Montreal as well. She was never going to be able to turn her back on all of that in the long run, unless Nick made her his priority. But Nick’s priority has always been Nick,” our source adds. Doesn’t sounds very fair, does it?

Following the announcement of their split on Aug. 25, Nick and Vanessa released the following statement to E! News: “It’s with a great amount of heartbreak for the both us as we have decided to end our engagement. We gave this relationship our all and we are saddened that we did not get the fairytale ending we hoped for. We will continue to be there for each other no matter what. This hasn’t been an easy decision, however, as we part ways, we do so with lots of love and admiration for each other.”

-1628359937,Watch Kanye West’s ‘American Idol’ audition,"Story highlights The rapper showed up at the San Francisco auditions The judges liked what they saw

Rolling Stone —

In October, Kanye West staged a surprise “American Idol” audition when the singing competition tried out hopefuls in San Francisco. With the 15th and final season of American Idol set to premiere January 6th, West’s full audition has been revealed via E!.

“My name is Kanye, I’m from the south side of Chicago,” West says while introducing himself to the judges. “I’m originally a producer. I always wanted to rap and no one really believed in me, so I wanted to try some things out, ya know?” Kim Kardashian, watching the audition on a monitor alongside Ryan Seacrest, tells the Idol host, “I’m not really nervous because I do really believe in him. I didn’t give any advice on singing, rapping. I just really believe in him.”

Before launching into the audition, West tells the judges – specifically Jennifer Lopez – he chose “Gold Digger” because “it has one of the judges’ names in it.” After wrapping up the a cappella rendition, the judges don’t even need to deliberate before quickly handing West his Golden Ticket to Hollywood Week; whether the rapper actually takes part in the next round remains to be seen.

“We were in San Francisco, and they said, ‘We’ve got a contestant that’s just going to jump into the line,’” Ryan Seacrest told E! News of the surprise audition. “And up walked Kim and Kanye—Kim pregnant and Kanye enthusiastic and ready to go in there. He walks in there and does a lyric about J.Lo from one of his songs.”

The West audition is just one of the many surprises American Idol is promising in its farewell season, which will both crown a new victor as well as look back at all the talents the series unearthed.

It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.

In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.

But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.

“For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”

O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.",fake

-1589096459,Justin Bieber Asks Selena Gomez To Join Him On Romantic Pre-Valentine’s Day Vacation At Luxury Resort,"Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are still very much in love, and we’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on their Valentine’s Day plans!



Meghan Markle and Prince Harry aren’t the only celebrity couple with special Valentine’s Day plans! Justin Bieber, 23, is putting his own twist on the romantic holiday by celebrating his love for Selena Gomez, 25, a few days early! “Justin is on his way out of town and he invited Selena Gomez to join him for a intimate getaway. Justin has left LA for some fun on a spiritual retreat, and he is hoping Selena will join him for a pre-Valentine’s vacation together. His plan is to stay at a secret location, at a luxury resort, a few hours outside of Los Angeles for at least a few nights and he’s hoping she will break away from her busy schedule to join him for some romantic time alone,” a source close to Justin tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Selena is one lucky woman, right?

JB’s romantic plans are especially sweet being that Selena just completed a two-week program at a treatment center for anxiety and depression. As we previously reported, Justin is living up to his boyfriend duties by making sure Selena is as happy and as healthy as possible. We definitely think an isolated trip to a luxury resort is all Selena needs right now, and it’s great to see Justin being so caring! Selena has certainly been through a lot this year. She received a kidney transplant and had a falling out with her mother Mandy Teefey after rekindling things with Justin.

We can only hope that Justin’s new efforts can earn him brownie points with Selena’s mom. After all, he seems to have turned over a new leaf since their relationship in 2009. The “What Do You Mean” singer has rededicated his life to religion, and was even spotted leaving a church service with his mom Pattie Mallette, 41, on Jan. 24. We love the new Justin!

What do you get a birthday girl who already has everything she could wish for? In Joe Alwyn‘s case, the 26-year-old is giving the gift of love and romance to girlfriend Taylor Swift as she turns 28 on Dec. 13. “Joe is planning a surprise romantic dinner and an intimate night alone with Taylor at a luxury hotel suite to help celebrate her birthday. Their romance has been amazing lately and Joe can’t wait to surprise Taylor with a passionate evening with just the two of them. Taylor and Joe are really falling in love with each other and things have never been better,” a source close to the British actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

“Joe has ordered dozens of red roses for their suite, several bottles of champagne and he is having a private chef who will cook them dinner and recreate one of her favorite dishes as part of their meal, sweet potato pancakes normally found at her favorite restaurant in Nashville. Joe even had a diamond pendant made for her with huge diamonds that form the shape of the number 13… her favorite number and the date of her birthday,” our insider adds. Diamonds are a girl’s best friend so there’s no way he can go wrong with that! See pics of Taylor’s epic 2017, here.

After a year of dating on the down-low, Taylor has slowly been allowing herself to be seen out in public with Joe. The “Ready For It” singer allowed herself to be photographed holding hands with Joe as they headed into her NYC pad’s front entrance on Dec. 9. She has a more private way to come and go from the place so it was a BIG DEAL that she finally was photographed showing PDA with him.

The next night she performed at London’s Jingle Ball and Tay was spotted out in the audience with Joe during pal Ed Sheeran‘s set. She had her arm around him while singing along to Ed’s smash “Thinking Out Loud” and was spotted hugging her boyfriend during other songs in the set. Fans freaked and posted the videos to Twitter and it was clear she is a-okay with the world knowing she’s with Joe.

Last month, Jennifer Garner was seen out with a “mystery man.” You can see the photos here, on The Daily Mail. The man had his arm around her but it didn’t look romantic and was more like a side hug as they walked. According to the National Enquirer, Garner has been seeing a lawyer and it’s so serious that she’s introduced him to her family in West Virginia. She allegedly did this over the holidays, which means she’s been with him for a while. There’s no mention in the article if it’s the same guy from the photos or if he’s met her kids.

Jennifer Garner… introduced her new lawyer beau to family members during a New Year’s weekend in Montana… “They stayed at a private residence in Yellowstone Club,” dished the source. “Jen and Ben arrived with the children. Ben celebrated Christmas with the kids but left to spend New Year’s with Lindsay. Jen’s boyfriend and her family arrived after Ben left… “In October, Jen’s sisters wanted to set her up on a blind date with a doctor, but she refused… “Everyone thought it was because Jen wanted to stay single. But it’s now looking more likely that she’d already found someone new!”

[From The National Enquirer, print edition, March 26, 2018]

It’s possible that The Enquirer found the identity of the guy in the photos and that he’s a lawyer but that Garner is just seeing him professionally. She must need legal services for her career and of course for her divorce. I hope this is true though. It’s just a sidebar article, they’re not honing in on US Weekly’s misleading cover about Ben and Jen’s non-reunion. How great would it be if Garner has an undercover civilian boyfriend and is just waiting for the right moment to premiere him? Would that tarnish her image as devoted separated mom or would she be celebrated as finally getting hers? I’m here for it, but the details are too vague at this point. For what it’s worth, Gossip Cop debunks this and says that Garner’s rep maintains that she’s single.",fake

“I do not know Post Malone, and I have no idea why he would say reckless things about our church, which he has never visited,” he continued. “Justin has not given our church $10 million, and we do not have gold ceilings. We do not even own a church building. So that gives you a little insight about how serious you can take his observations about anything to do with us.”

The phone call Kim, 35, released on her Snapchat between Taylor, 26, and Kanye, 39, was no random action. In fact, the reality star and the fashion designer tag-teamed the entire thing. “Kim and Kanye discussed everything about the Taylor Swift video before releasing it. Kanye was in on the plan to release the tape as was Kim‘s entire team of lawyers, managers and publicists. Everything Kim did was carefully planned, timed and calculated for maximum effect,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com.

Although it could have been seen as an attack on the “Bad Blood” singer, it was all in the name of defense for the pair. The two both had their own part in the plan and “Kim wanted to set the record straight with Taylor and Kanye once and for all. This was not something Kim did spontaneously or without discussing it with her husband, or the people she leans on for support and guidance. Kanye was part of digging up the film and making it available to Kim so she could post it. This was coordinated and well-planned.” With her loved ones in mind, “Kim was adamant on doing what was right to defend her family name and that is why she released the tape,” the source added.

Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.

Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week’s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!”

An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.

However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.

According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn’t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin — Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.

Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old “X-Men” co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.

In a new cover interview with Billboard, the “Wolves” singer, 25, sets the record straight on all the rumors.

“Something that I’m really proud of is that there’s such a true friendship [between me and The Weeknd],” she told the outlet. “I truly have never experienced anything like that in my life. We ended it as best friends, and it was genuinely about encouraging and caring [for each other], and that was pretty remarkable for me.”

Billboard

Sources previously told PEOPLE the pair’s relationship became difficult because of The Weeknd’s touring schedule and Gomez’s shooting commitments for her upcoming Woody Allen film.

As for reuniting with Bieber, 23 — whom she’s had an on and off relationship with since 2010 — “I’m 25. I’m not 18, or 19, or 20,” she said. “I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn’t right. But that doesn’t mean caring for someone ever goes away.”

The star, who is being honored Thursday night as the outlet’s “Woman of the Year,” also got candid about her self-esteem after undergoing a kidney transplant earlier this summer.

-141965938,Brad Pitt: Partying at Nightclubs as Friends Fear Relapse,"Back in May, following months of rumors about his personal life and the state of his mental health, Brad Pitt admitted to struggling with a drinking problem and seeking treatment for substance abuse.

In a surprisingly candid interview with GQ, the 53-year-old Pitt revealed that he had been drinking heavily since college and couldn't recall going a single day in his adult life without some sort of inebriant.

After a tumultuous year, Pitt's life is reportedly settling back down these days.

His formerly contentious custody battle with Angelina Jolie is said to have reached a more civil stage in which both parties are working together to figure out an arrangement that works best for their kids.

The actor is working again, and there are rumors that Pitt is romantically involved with Sienna Miller.

Of course, his sobriety is still relatively new, and thus, rather fragile.

Anyone who's struggled with addiction can tell you that at the point Pitt's at now, it's a near-constant battle.

So it's no surprise that friends are said to be concerned by reports that Pitt was recently spotted partying at a nightclub into the wee hours.

According to Radar online, Pitt was ""the last man standing"" at the Rabbit Hole Club in England on June 23, where he partied until 3 am after spending the day at the Glastonbury Festival.

""At this rate, Brad’s heading for a major relapse, and he’s only going to push Angie’s buttons if she thinks Brad’s flirting with Sienna,"" a source close to the situation tells Radar.

A relapse, of course, would be devastating not only in terms of Pitt's health and overall well-being, but also with regard to his custody rights.

Insiders say he and Jolie have reached a point where they're amicably co-parenting their six children, but that peace is rumored to be tenuous.

""Right now Angie holds all the aces in terms of custody, so Brad needs to keep on her good side,"" says the source.

Hopefully, Pitt's been able to party without getting drunk or high.

If that's not the case, we hope for both his sake and the sake of his children that he'll be able to find the help he needs.",fake

After living apart for two years, Affleck and Garner decided to go their separate ways.

The actors were married for 12 years and have three children together – 11-year-old Violet, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.

Very rapidly, Affleck revealed to the world that he was in a serious relationship with Lindsay Shookus.

Rumors are claiming the movie maker and his new lady secretly started dating in 2012.

Affleck has been seen on romantic dinner dates with the Saturday Night Live producer, and the pair has moved into a home together.

A source has come out to say; Garner is feeling lonely and abandoned by the father of her children who has found a new love.

A friend explained: “Jen is hurt and humiliated by Ben’s very public romance.”

The chatty insider added: “Jen has never been about getting retribution. That is not her style. But Ben’s insensitive actions have changed her. She could never really trust Ben. He is no longer hiding his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay, and Jen has hit a breaking point.”

According to Star, Garner has turned to the Church of Scientology for help.

The famous actress has been feeling tired, going through sleepless nights, and is hoping that Tom Cruise’s controversial church will help her get back on her feet.

Garner is allegedly doing therapy and trying other alternative techniques that can help her mental state and physical well-being.

A person on her team claimed that the story is not true and that Garner regularly attends the Community United Methodist Church.

This is not the first time, Garner has been linked to Church of Scientology.

Andrew Morton, author of Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography, claimed in 2004, Garner and an extensive list of Hollywood stunners were contacted by the action movie star to be his wife.

Morton wrote: “Cruise left messages on the Alias star’s voice mail in 2004 asking “if she knew what freedom was,” but his advances were rebuffed .. Katie Holmes accepted the offer and signed a contract to commit to Scientology and that her father brokered a high-paying prenup.”

-140849966,Beyonce and Jay-Z Building Million Dollar Nursery For Twins?,"Beyonce is pregnant with twins, as everybody on the planet knows by now. And according to a new report, Beyonce also wants to built a million dollar nursery for these twins. Okay, actually, Beyonce and Jay-Z want to build this nursery. But let’s be real – if Beyonce wants something, you think Jay-Z is going to say no?

And also, when was the last time we saw Jay-Z claiming to want something, and Beyonce jumping on that bandwagon? And don’t say a divorce #neverforgetthelevatorincident. Anyway, Radar’s source claims, “Beyonce told Jay Z she wants a million-dollar nursery in her home! The place will have two of everything. It must have two lamps, changing tables, cribs, stuffed animals and a closet stocked with baby designer duds from Lanvin and Hermes…. money is no object. It has to be perfect.”

Well, duh to that last part. ‘Money is no object’, as though that even needed to be stated. Truthfully, the fact that this is news is somewhat mind boggling. Why does the fact that Beyonce wants a fancy, expensive nursery need to become a thing? In fact, it would have been more news-worthy had Beyonce NOT wanted a million dollar nursery? Have you SEEN Blue Ivy’s clothes?!

The more interesting part of this report is the fact that Beyonce ‘told’ Jay-Z she wants a million dollar nursery, not that Jay-Z is ‘enthusiastic’ about a million dollar nursery. Again, what Beyonce wants, Beyonce gets. But the phrasing of this report is definitely curious; it was alleged for a while that Jay-Z and Beyonce were still biding their time to announce a separation, or at least, a trial separation – and then bam, the announcement that came instead was that Beyonce was pregnant with twins. It’s hard to believe that everything is suddenly hunky dory just because Beyonce is pregnant now.

If anything, the problems between the two are likely amplified, but we’re not hearing anything because Beyonce shut down the leaks in her camp. And now, we’ll hear only what she wants us to hear – like the fact that she wants a fancy nursery for her twins.

In Touch has obtained a video showing that the devastating situation is even worse than Khloé knows. An insider reveals the shocking details from Tristan’s hookups with a curvy stunner last November and again in February.

Tristan hit on the woman at an NYC club following a November game against the New York Knicks. And while the woman — who the source says is a big fan of the Kardashians — “knew that he was with Khloé,” Tristan didn’t mention his pregnant girlfriend when he brought her back to the Four Seasons in an SUV. He got out first and had her circle the block a few times before coming up to his room, where they had unprotected sex.

“She slept with him because he’s an NBA star, but she thinks he’s hot, too,” the insider says. “She said that the sex was good.” So good, the woman stayed the night and took a short video of Tristan — identifiable by his distinctive chest tattoos — asleep in bed afterward, which the source shared exclusively with In Touch.

“He was definitely not careful at all about making sure that nobody knew who she was or that she didn’t have her phone,” adds the source. In the video, two phones are visible on the nightstand. The source says they’re both Tristan’s, adding, “It’s so sketchy.”

In the morning, they swapped numbers for a potential round two. And the woman heard from Tristan right away — but he wasn’t looking for another hookup. He wanted to make sure she didn’t get pregnant! “He texted her, ‘Do you have Plan B?’” says the source, referencing the so-called morning-after pill.

Three months passed before they hooked up again. Out of the blue, Tristan texted the woman and invited her to see his team play in another city in February. “He paid for her flight,” says the source. “And she slept over again.”

When something needs to be protected and somebody else doesn’t understand the importance of that. That’s a problem.

Kris also makes it clear that she’ll take legal action against an employee that does something wrong and will hold them accountable.

We obviously will go to and spare [raises voice] no expense to hold somebody accountable if that happens on our team. I don’t care how much money somebody might have, if they have nothing. Some people think, ‘Oh, I don’t have any money, and they’re not going to sue me.’

Well, we’ll take payments. We’ll garner those wages for, you know, the next 10 years. But I just think that people don’t think. It’s a foolish thing to do. Some people think, ‘Oh, I don’t have any money, and they’re not going to sue me.’ Well, we’ll take payments.

-1410317058,Why Princess Charlotte Never Wears Pants,"It’s been widely reported that the future King of England isn’t allowed to wear pants, but it seems his younger sister Princess Charlotte also has to abide by royal style rules.

While Prince George is barely ever seen out of his little blue shorts, three-year-old Charlotte is always sporting a feminine dress.

Though Meghan Markle has been told not to wear a tuxedo because the Queen prefers women in skirts and dresses, the reason Princess Charlotte is always in a frock is less extreme: Kate Middleton wants to keep her daughter in classic looks so the photos don’t date.

“If they wear very simple things… it’s timeless in that you can’t really date a specific photo or put them in something that seems out of date,” designer Rachel Riley, who has dressed Prince George before, told The Telegraph.

Woman and Home also notes that Kate puts Charlotte in traditional ‘old-fashioned’ outfits for official royal occasions because it marks the formality of the event.

Fans believed at first that the guy was a Spanish footballer, but he turned out to be a Saudi billionaire. He is the deputy president and vice chairman of Abdul Latif Jameel, one of the largest companies in the world. The Barbadian singer was in an on-and-off relationship with Chris Brown, 28, and it looks like her new beau fears that the “With You” singer might win her back.

A source close to Rihanna, 29, recently told Hollywood Life that Jameel is worried that Brown keeps “lurking in her past” and is being unpredictable. Although RiRi has opened up to her new beau about her past, the Toyota heir is still concerned that Breezy can still win her back. He feels uncomfortable with the idea that the “Kiss Kiss” singer still loves her and might be able to take her back from him anytime.

However, a separate source previously told the same news outlet that Rihanna hopes that the well-heeled Saudi Arabian can help her forget her dark past with Chris Brown. Now, fans are convinced that she has moved on gracefully from Breezy. The “Umbrella” singer recently stepped out with her new flame Hassan Jameel at the Grammys despite keeping their relationship under wraps.

“He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy. Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.”

Although they also attended the Grammys after-party in New York City, the couple still tried to keep it low-key. They were spotted leaving the club separately, with Rihanna exiting the club right after Jameel had left.

Following her performance at the Grammys, some fans suggested that Rihanna is pregnant with Jameel’s baby as her tight outfit appears to have shown a tiny baby bump. However, another insider also told Hollywood Life that the Barbadian singer is not pregnant, and is not trying to get pregnant either. The source went on to say that RiRi believes her new boyfriend. who is worth $1.5 billion, would make a good father.

‘Nicole and Keith went for an emergency stay,’ an insider is sensationally quoted as saying by the publication. ‘It was an extremely emotional and testing few days.’

‘Friends think this will end in divorce,’ the source told the magazine.

The outrageous report that has stunned fans around the world (Credit: In Touch magazine)

Nicole and Keith have been married for 12 years, but according to In Touch there are just too many obstacles for the couple to overcome. Nicole has reportedly struggled to deal with the legacy of Keith’s past addiction issues, as well as time apart, and rumours of antics on the road.

‘They have been putting a Band-Aid over their problems for too long,’ claimed the insider. ‘While they have smiles plastered on their faces in public, in private, things have been falling apart.’

The trip to Vermont marked an attempt to patch things up, according to the publication.

It was allegedly Keith who wanted to take the trip to Vermont with Nicole initially refusing to go, claims In Touch.

‘They addressed a range of issues including emotional intimacy and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,’ explained the source.

Keith and Nicole have yet to respond to In Touch‘s allegations, and have always maintained that they enjoy a happy marriage.

Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.

All hell broke loose.

Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.

Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”

“The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”

In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”

According to a new report, The Voice coach is ready for Blake’s ex-wife to leave his name out of her mouth after Miranda seemingly threw shade at the “Honey Bee” singer during her ACM‘s acceptance speech for Album of the Year.

MORE: Miranda Lambert Announces Her Engagement!

“Gwen thinks Miranda really needs to focus on her current relationship and not her ex. Gwen gets that Miranda’s split with Blake was heartbreaking but come on, it’s time to move on,” a source told Hollywood Life. “Gwen struggled to get over Gavin [Rossdale] but she did it and now it’s all about her relationship with Blake. None of them need to be living in the past!”

Even though Miranda has moved on with Anderson East, who accompanied her to Sunday night’s show, she still made it a point to bring up the “heartbreak” that her ex-husband caused.

“I just want to say thank you for letting me release my heartbreak and sharing it with me,” she said.

The couple announced back in July 2015 that they finalized their divorce after four years of marriage, which was right around when Gwen filed to end her marriage from the Bush front man.

It was revealed in November of that year that Gwen and Blake started dating. The “Little Red Wagon” singer moved on shortly after with Anderson — though these ladies have been at odds ever since the mother-of-three started dating her co-star.

“Miranda would welcome a showdown with Gwen, to get everything in the open once and for all,” a source previously told In Touch.

She’s also taken issue with the constant gushing Gwake does over each other in public.

“Miranda is tired of Gwen incessantly gushing about her romance with Blake,” said another source. “She’s sick to death of Blake carrying on in interviews about how Gwen ‘saved my life’ and saying he was ‘at rock bottom, in the middle of hell’ after their divorce.”

When Diana gave birth to her future king in 1982, her insistence on hands-on parenting was seen as revolutionary. After all, a newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II left young kids Prince Charles and Princess Anne in the care of his grandparents and household staff to embark on a six-month tour of the Commonwealth shortly after her coronation. And her decisions to let them wear jeans and baseball caps and eat McDonald's hamburgers, while not express defiance of any sort of rule, were certainly not the done thing.

Now the 36-year-old and his wife Kate Middleton, 36, are following in her trailblazing footsteps. While the pair certainly abide by many royal traditions—today, after all, 11-week-old Louis was baptized at St. James's Palace wearing a replica of the intricate lace and satin dress made for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter in 1841, the same outfit his older siblings donned—they're keen to give their tiny heirs a life outside the gilded walls of Kensington Palace. ""They feel it's important to make them aware of their backgrounds,"" a source told Us Weekly. But it's also ""vital"" for their kids—third, fourth and fifth in line for the British throne, respectively—""to have as much normalcy in their lives as possible.""

So far, they feel they've struck just the right balance. As William told BBC News in 2016, ""As far as we're concerned, within our family unit, we are a normal family. I love my children the same way any father does.""",fake

The gorgeous singer showed up to one of the music’s biggest nights with her beau Hassan Jameel. “Drake thought Rihanna looked incredibly sexy at the Grammys,” a source close to the hip hop star EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “He did not think she looked pregnant at all, just healthy, happy and really sexy. Watching her dance and shaking her body all over the stage really turned him on, he was totally into it. Drake was shocked and surprised over the subsequent pregnancy rumors that followed her big appearance.” Woah! It sounds like Drake is still hooked on RiRi and we can definitely see why! The talented star is known for having confidence in her body and it sure showed during her incredible energetic Grammys performance of “Wild Thoughts.”

Although speculation of a pregnancy soared after Rihanna’s performance, she has yet to publicly comment about it. She is, however, reportedly laughing it off and having the time of her life despite what others think of her weight. Drake may have had great feelings about checking Rihanna out at the Grammys but it quickly turned into disappointment when he found out she was still with Hassan. “He was also disappointed to hear that things between Rihanna and Hassan are still stable and that he was in NYC with her,” the source continued. “Drake still finds Rihanna really sexy, thinks they have great chemistry together and feels like they will get together again one day, hopefully soon.”

Drake and Rihanna have a long history of a complicated on-again, off-again relationship that started around 2009 when they were first spotted together at a bowling alley, according to E! News. From friends to collaborators to lovers, these two have had tons of experience being together so it’s not surprising that Drake would feel such a connection to the beauty. Whether or not they’ll end up together again is yet to be seen but it’s good to know Drizzy can still appreciate all RiRi has to offer!

Britain's Daily Mail newspaper has published a public apology to music icon Sir Elton John for insinuating in a previous article that he had ""misled people about his reasons"" for cancelling a charity concert only to perform live in London a few nights later.

The piece, according to its timestamp, was published at midnight and reads:

""A recent article, ‘£3.5m wedding singers’, said that Sir Elton John had cancelled a charity gig in Dubai for medical reasons yet had performed at a lucrative private event in London a few days after the announcement. In fact, the Dubai concert at the Autism Rocks arena was not a charity event but part of Sir Elton’s Wonderful Crazy Night Tour. It was cancelled on doctor’s orders because of an unavoidable medical procedure which prevented international travel. We did not intend to suggest that he had misled people about his reasons for the cancellation. We apologise for any such impression and have agreed a payment to charity and costs.""

Last night, at the 2024 Governors Awards, where Honorary Oscars are handed out ahead of the big show later in the season, Robbie swapped her Barbie wardrobe for something a little more Parisian. She skipped out on the pink for a bejeweled Celine gown with a shimmering, plunging V-neckline and a sprinkling of cutouts across the bodice.

Robbie skipped out on a necklace to let the jeweled neckline take the spotlight. The embellishment swooped down her chest and around her back, outlining the cutouts over her abs and sides. She kept her hair down and parted in the middle and finished the glam look with jewelry from Fred Leighton and heels from Manolo Blahnik.

After the SAG Award nominations were announced this morning, Barbie earned Best Supporting Actor and Best Actress nods for Ryan Gosling and Robbie, respectively. Gosling will go against Robert Downey Jr., who is nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category for Oppenheimer, and Cillian Murphy earned a nod for Best Actor.

Both blockbusters are also up for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The two films aren't going up against each other in one very specific category: Outstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture. In that case, Barbie is up against Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, John Wick: Chapter 4, and Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.

Ex-flames Brad and Ange have been working together for the better part of 18 months to reach an agreement on the custody of their six children – Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne – and according to Life & Style, the former couple have managed to come to an agreement.

The publication’s report reveals Brad was left ‘devastated’ when Ange told him she had planned to take their children to London with her for five months while she filmed Maleficent 2.

‘Even though Brad knows Angelina has custody and he has visitation, he felt it was a major breach in their agreement,’ a family friend spilled to the publication. ‘He was livid.’

Life & Style claim Brad then waged a war on his ex-wife, and that he came out on top!

The friend tells, ‘To keep him from contesting her London move, she promised Brad that he can spend longer periods of time with the kids before and after the trip.’

‘When he found out he was getting more time with them, Brad cried tears of joy,’ the friend adds.

The Hollywood actor has since been spending much more time with his six children, something he considers a ‘major victory.’

Life & Style reveal the kids are ‘ecstatic’ to be spending more time with their dad.

Friends close to the pair also reveal that although the kids love Ange, they ‘always wanted to be with their Dad more.’

Getting sober and being in therapy has only made Brad’s bond with his children stronger, the publication adds.

‘He really feels he’s turned a negative into a positive by getting more time with the kids,’ says the family friend. ‘He’s never going to let them get too far away again.’

Friends close to the star also revealed to PEOPLE that he is ‘more like the old happy and charming Brad,’

Gigi knows that Kendall puts work and her career first with little time for a serious boyfriend or a long term relationship.

Guess what? They're all hers. But she followed up with this: ""Everything about me is fake except my cheeks,"" she said, laughing and pointing to her forehead, nose, and lips. ""Fake, fake, fake.""

With her usual refreshing candor, Teigen went on to explain why she's happy with her decision to get treatments done—a friendly reminder that celebrities are humans with insecurities too. ""I had my armpit sucked out,"" she said, noting that the liposuction procedure wasn't exactly necessary but that it made her feel better. ""It added two inches of length to my arms. [That fat] is coming back though, so I might need to go in and pay for it again."" To put it in better context, she said that last line while laughing.

While no celebrity is ever obligated to discuss something so intimate as fillers or facial surgery, it's great that Teigen's choosing to do so. Just like how you wear your hair or your taste in how sparkly highlighter should be, plastic surgery is a purely personal choice—and it's one that shouldn't be criticized. If we're to celebrate women having autonomy over their own body and health, this is a taboo (and recurring tabloid speculation staple) that's got to go.

Plastic surgery stigma: 0. Chrissy Teigen: too many to count.

Britney Spears was “jumped on” by fans during her first visit to Israel. The megastar was forced to skip dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after she was mobbed by her followers during a visit to the historical site the Western Wall and security were eventually forced to whisk her away.

A source told Ynet, “Hundreds of people jumped on her, and she decided to cancel it all. It was a huge mess, with hundreds of fans and photographers gathered around her. It was a real ‘Israeli celebration’; she didn’t stop an excursion during any other part of her latest tour. This could only happen here.”

Britney landed in Israel on Sunday, on 2 July, 2017 and the country’s Labour Party cancelled planned elections because of her concert at Tel Aviv’s Yarkon Park on Monday night, which was attended by 50,000 of her fans. She also visited holy sites such as the city of Jerusalem during her stay.

Meanwhile, the ‘Hit Me Baby One More Time’ hitmaker recently claimed she doesn’t get the credit she deserves for her on-stage performances. Britney slammed suggestions she simply lip-syncs throughout her shows, insisting she has to mix her own voice with “a little bit of playback” because of her energy-sapping dance routines.

-6988354769,Aaron Rodgers Girlfriend: Is Packers QB Dating Soccer Star Marie Margolius? [VIDEO],"Aaron Rodgers is reportedly moving on from his controversial relationship with actress Olivia Munn with soccer star Marie Margolius.

Following years of rumors which suggested that Munn had led the Green Bay Packers quarterback to be estranged from his family, including brother Jordan Rodgers, who won the heart of Jojo Fletcher on the 2016 season of The Bachelorette, he is said to be enjoying a new romance with his fellow athlete.

Earlier this month, a Page Six report told readers that Rodgers had been spotted on a date with the soccer player at the Martignetti brothers’ Upper East Side hotsplit East Pole.

“They arrived at around 10 p.m. and seemed to be on a date. He wore a baseball cap and asked for the quietest, most out-of-the-way table possible. His hat was tilted down. It definitely seemed like he wanted to be incognito,” an insider told the outlet.

Meanwhile, Munn is reportedly upset about Rodgers' alleged new relationship because he reportedly gave her hope for a future reunion before stepping out with Margolius.

Munn is “in pieces” over Rodgers' new relationship, a source told OK! Magazine on August 28. “Aaron told Olivia he was in love with her but that he needed some space; he promised to stay friends and said they would reevaluate things down the line.”

“But instead he started dating and left Olivia feeling played. To see him move on with someone else in such a public fashion is like a knife through the heart,” the source continued.

“She’s trying to play it cool, but it’s obvious she’s still in love with him,” the insider added.

-6984927757,Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Wedding Rumors Fueled by Matching Rings,"Miley Cyrus was spotted—totally pants-less—in Savana, Georgia on a coffee run with fiancé (or husband, as many suspect), Liam Hemsworth. The rumor mill has recently been claiming that the pair secretly wed in a private ceremony nearly seven months ago and simply never made an announcement to the public.

For the morning coffee date (where they were met by Miley’s mom, Trish), Miley chose an oversized pullover that made her look totally pants-less. Though it’s unclear whether she was sporting some shorts underneath, they would have to be pretty micro-mini, as there was no hint of anything peeking out of the bottom of her already short tunic top. She kicked her look up a notch with classic black Dr. Martens (which you can buy here).

Both the 24-year-old singer and her 27-year-old beau are still sporting rings on THAT finger, further leading to speculation that the pair have secretly said their vows. For such a photographed couple, however, we kind of love the prospect that they call each other husband and wife and the public is none the wiser.

""Y'all need to chill lol hand-holding is a very common thing,"" she posted in a since-deleted tweet along with pictures of her holding hands with her female friends, including Sofia Richie.

Trevor, who is 38, also denied the relationship in a statement provided to Just Jared Jr.

“They are just friends,” a rep for the actor said. ""Both are big animal lovers and advocates and are working on a ‘Be Pawsome, Adopt!’ campaign for local L.A. shelters.... They are friends who want to help the helpless.”

A spokesman for Enquirer parent company AMI told TheWrap that the matter has been “amicably resolved.”

TheWrap has also reached out to Sheen’s legal representative for comment.

According to TMZ, Sheen’s legal team filed papers late last week asking that the suit be dismissed with prejudice, which means that the suit can’t be filed again.

Sheen filed the suit in December, accusing the publication of defamation. The suit resulted from a Nov. 8 article that quoted former actor Dominick Brascia as saying Haim told him that Sheen and Haim “smoked pot and had sex. He said they had anal sex. Haim said after it happened Sheen became very cold and rejected him. When Corey wanted to fool around again, Charlie was not interested.”

In a statement released by his attorney, Shane Bernard, after the complaint was filed, Sheen said, “In my nearly 35 years as a celebrated entertainer, I have been nothing shy of a forthright, noble and valiant courier of the truth.”

Sheen continued, “Consistently admitting and owning a laundry list of shortcomings, wrongdoings and indiscretions this traveler hath traveled — however, every man has a breaking point. These radically groundless and unfounded allegations end now. I now take a passionate stand against those who wish to even entertain the sick and twisted lies against me. GAME OVER.”",fake

-6941098368,Angelina Jolie Snubbed Margot Robbie Because of Brad Pitt Rumors,"Looks like Margot Robbie is going to need some aloe for this burn! At the Hollywood Film Awards on Sunday, Nov. 5 in LA, Margot, 27, excitedly approached Angelina Jolie to introduce herself. But instead of a warm reply, Angie “curtly replied, ‘I know who you are’ and turned her back on Margot,” an insider exclusively tells In Touch.

According to the source, the Australian-born beauty “looked shocked.” Jealousy may be to blame. When Margot starred in 2015’s The Big Short alongside Angelina’s ex Brad Pitt, “rumors swirled about Brad crushing on Margot and that Angelina had tried to stop Brad from casting Margot in the film,” says the insider.

(Photo Credit: Splash)

The source says that the mom-of-six — who shares Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9, and Knox, 9, with Brad, 53 — can’t shake her resentment toward the Suicide Squad actress. “It was clear from Angelina’s reaction to Margot that she still holds a grudge,” the source says.

Back in November 2016, not long after Angelina, 42, filed for divorce from Brad, OK! Magazine reported that the Fight Club hunk was “ready to move on” with Margot. “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now,” a source said at the time. “This was a sore subject with [Angelina] who blocked them from working together a few times. Now that he’s single again, you can expect Brad to go after Margot with a passion.”

While a romance between Brad and Margot never flourished, the eternal heartthrob has recently fell for 21-year-old British actress Ella Purnell — who, in an ironic twist, played a young Angelina in 2014’s Maleficent. He’s so enchanted, a source previously told In Touch, that he cast her in his upcoming Starz series, Sweetbitter.

“Brad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,” said the source. “Ella is incredibly flattered by all the attention she’s getting from Brad. She’s told friends he’s always been her No. 1 celebrity crush.”

However, when Prince Harry took the unusual step of inviting his ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, to his royal wedding she gladly accepted.

But, as Bonas revealed Thursday, that does not mean she did feel anxious about attending. The model, 29, opened up about the experience and what she worried about most about her ex’s wedding to Meghan Markle in a column for U.K. magazine The Spectator.

“Friends are starting to get married, which means the dilemma of British wedding attire. Hats,” Bonas admitted. “Why do I find hats so tricky? Tricky to wear, tricky to look at, and extremely tricky for the poor soul sitting in the pew behind.”

“Most of the time I avoid headgear,” she revealed. “This can prompt disapproving looks from the older generations. Last weekend I attended the royal wedding. The invitation clearly stated that guests must wear hats. Yikes.”

She added, “I opted for a minimal feathered number — and can only hope I got it right.”

Bonas dated Harry, 33, for two years after being introduced to him by his cousin Princess Eugenie.

The two parted ways amicably in 2014. He also invited former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, who he dated on-and-off from 2004 to 2011.

RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan’s Love Story

It was reportedly a dislike of the media attention and public scrutiny that came along with dating Harry that led to the demise of both relationships.

Davy said that she and Harry still kept in touch. “I think we will always be good friends,” she told The Sunday Times style section.

While it is not common for commoners to invite their former lovers to their nuptials, there’s royal precedent for inviting your exes to your big day.

Prince William invited a number of women he had previously been romantically linked to – Rose Farquhar, Olivia Hunt, Arabella Musgrave and Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, who is Bonas’s half-sister – as well as his ex-girlfriend, Jecca Craig, to his 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton.",fake

And this privacy most keenly, and understandably, applies to their almost two-year-old son Jack who is largely absent from Huntington-Whitely's Instagram page.

The former ELLE UK cover star has kept her son's face hidden or largely obscured on the photo-sharing app since his birth in 2017 - until now.

In our biggest glimpse of little Jack yet, the Rose Inc founder posted a carousel of black and white snaps of the pair for a Pipette Baby advert.

The toddler can be seen grinning at his model (figuratively and literally) mother wearing a nappy whilst sitting in a very professional-looking leather chair - probably already preparing to take over his mother's beauty business when he turns 18.

'It sounds so clichéd, but it’s just been the most magical experience.' The former Victoria's Secret angel told Harper's Bazaar of her move into motherhood, 'Everything feels so special and sweet and wholesome and loving and then at the same time it's been... life-changing, and my focus is now this person; this is what I want to do.

'This is what I want to pour my heart into now.'

In the story, published over the weekend, Lynch told the newspaper that Trump ""could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the thing so much."" He added, ""No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.""

His remarks stood out in a week when celebrities roundly criticized the president over his immigration policy calling for the separation of immigrant parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump even referenced them Monday night during a rally in South Carolina.

But despite Trump's claim that Lynch, ""a Hollywood guy,"" had endorsed his performance as president, Lynch had actually been trying to point out how Trump's election and administration had put a spotlight on the inefficiency of government. (“Our so-called leaders can’t take the country forward, can’t get anything done. Like children, they are. Trump has shown all this,” Lynch told The Guardian.)

In a Facebook post published Tuesday, the ""Twin Peaks creator addressed Trump directly, saying he wished they ""could sit down and have a talk.""

He warned the president, ""If you continue as you have been, you will not have a chance to go down in history as a great president. This would be very sad it seems for you – and for the country. You are causing suffering and division.""

Lynch continued, ""It’s not too late to turn the ship around. Point our ship toward a bright future for all. You can unite the country. Your soul will sing. Under great loving leadership, no one loses – everybody wins. It’s something I hope you think about and take to heart. All you need to do is treat all the people as you would like to be treated.""

This was just one year after husband René Angélil passed away from a heart attack. Here’s what we know about their relationship and Dion’s alleged boyfriend.

Her reps originally denied the reports, insisting that the two are just friends. About a year ago, the two were spotted together in Paris, where Muñoz accompanied her to the Giambattista Valli fashion show.

Muñoz told Vogue about working with and getting to know Dion.

“She’s the kind of person [for whom] the day has no schedule, no time, no nothing, so whenever she feels the creativity coming, that’s what happens,” he said. “She makes you feel welcome, like you belong to the family, and like you’re part of the group. She’s absolutely fearless with her style, her dancing, her performing, and as a person in her clothes.”

However, in April 2017, Dion told The Sun she wasn’t ready to enter the dating world again.

“Now it is definitely too soon for me… I am definitely in love with [René], married to him,” she said.

GET CELINE DION CONCERT TICKETS!

In January of this year, the 34-year-old said he and Dion found the rumors to be funny.

“These rumors really amused us,” he told Gala. “And we still laugh about them.”

Muñoz added, “I can count on her when I need to talk, and I am ready to listen to her, too.”

During a January 2017 concert, the two shared a sensual number on-stage, fueling the dating rumors.

The dancer is from Malaga, Spain, and is also an illustrator. He attended the Royal Academy of Dancing and even performed in the Cirque du Soleil show Zumanity.

He was first asked to dance for Dion by her personal assistant and eagerly jumped at the opportunity.

“I’d always been a great fan, not like a psycho fan, but I’ve always loved her music,” Muñoz said. “I said ‘yes,’ of course, then rapidly went to the gym to start doing sit-ups.”

Nonetheless, their insistence on being just friends has quelled the rumors since.

Abandoning his precisely chosen and carefully delivered condemnations of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis from a day earlier, the president furiously stuck by his initial reaction to the unrest in Charlottesville. He drew the very moral equivalency for which a bipartisan chorus, and his own advisers, had already criticized him.

“I think there is blame on both sides,” the president said in a combative exchange with reporters at Trump Tower in Manhattan. “You had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say that. I’ll say it right now.”

Mr. Trump defended those gathered in a Charlottesville park to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. “I’ve condemned neo-Nazis. I’ve condemned many different groups,” he said. “Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.”

Mr. and Mrs. Clooney are very busy people, their respective careers take them all over the world and sometimes they are even forced to travel to dangerous and war-torn countries.

The pair also shares three mansions in California, Italy, and England, so it is not surprising that the parents-to-be have begun looking for an extra pair of hands to help them with their bundle of joys.

Anxious to play the biggest role in his life, the father-to-be was eager to start interviewing candidates who were qualified for the job when he learned that Amal’s primary concern is the nanny’s looks.

The actor’s wife does not want a beautiful woman to help her raise her twins because she has watched so many marriages destroyed by young, hot and fit help.

The international human rights lawyer, 39, is aware that her spouse is considered as one the most handsome men in the world and has dated half of the stunners in Hollywood, so she will go out of her way to make sure he is never tempted.

A source close to the respected attorney had the following to say: “Amal refuses to end up like Jennifer Garner or Gwen Stefani, and so she’ll hire dowdy helpers, so her spouse won’t be tempted to stray.”

The insider went on to explain: “She trusts George, but she’s seen way too many A-list men get sucked in by starstruck caregivers. She married the sexiest bachelor alive, and she intends to protect him from any potential honey trap.”

In photos circulating social media, Baldwin is seen wearing a huge oval diamond engagement ring set on what looks to be a rose gold pavé diamond band. A second solo wedding-like band is seen on top of the diamond.

“Justin is of course ahead of the trends, selecting an oval stone for Hailey’s ring, which has been somewhat rare over the past decade but is making a huge resurgence,” Andrew Brown, President of WP Diamonds tells PEOPLE. “Hailey’s oval stone is about six carats, F-G color grade and VS clarity, making it one of the better diamonds out there. Set in an elegant rose gold pavé band, the retail on this stone would be around $400,000.”

And while Baldwin is wearing what looks like a wedding band, a source tells PEOPLE this trip was all about an engagement.

“Justin picked out the ring before they flew to the Bahamas,” a source close to the Canadian superstar, 24, told PEOPLE exclusively. “He took Hailey on a special trip to propose. She didn’t know.”

Bieber was “nervous but excited,” ahead of the proposal, adds the source. “He is super happy that she said, ‘Yes.'”

Things are getting nasty behind the scenes at the palace, as Camilla has raised the stakes in her feud against Kate, 36, and Meghan Markle – teaming up with Princess Eugenie in a war of the weddings.

Things came to a head at a recent visit to St George’s Chapel, where both Meghan and the recently engaged Princess Eugenie are planning on holding their weddings later this year.

With Camilla in tow to help the 27-year-old go over plans for her wedding to Jack Brooksbank, the pair were horrified to bump into Kate and Meghan.

While Kate and Meghan were, of course, very police and lovely, Camilla, 70, took the opportunity to really make her feelings known, telling 36-year-old Meghan that she really disapproves of her wedding to Harry overshadowing Eugenie’s.

‘When they came face-to-face, Camilla really let Meghan have it. She told her she thought it was atrocious she and Harry were ruining Eugenie’s wedding plans – that Harry should have known that Eugenie had always wanted to marry at St George’s chapel,’ says the insider.

It was confirmed last week that Eugenie has been forced to delay her wedding with the princess originally hoping to tie the knot in September, but settling for October.

Camilla – who is reported to be jealous of Kate and Meghan’s rising popularity – has also been causing tension among the royals, with sources saying that one of the scheming duchess’ more brazen plots involved trying to convince Kate that Meghan was trying to steal some of her staff.

According to insiders, it was Camilla who was behind the reassignment of Amy Pickerill from Kate and Wills’ communications officer to Meghan’s first royal assistant.

An insider tells, ‘It shows that Camilla will stop at nothing to cause trouble between Kate and Meghan.’

Stand Up, Don’t Shoot, described as a stand-up special in which Cannon takes on race and other topics, premiered Friday on Showtime.

.

“After days of deliberating over some extremely disappointing news that I was being threatened with termination by Executives because of a comedy special that was only intended to bring communities closer together, I was to be punished for a joke,” he writes on Instagram and Facebook. “This has weighed heavy on my spirit. It was brought to my attention by my “team” that NBC believed that I was in breach of contract because I had disparaged their brand. In my defense, I would ask how so? Or is this just another way to silence and control an outspoken voice who often battles the establishment.”

What Cannon is referring to is a fairly standard clause in employment contracts that does not allow an employee to disparage the company they work for. He goes on to say,” I find myself in a dark place having to make a decision that I wish I didn’t have to, but as a man, an artist, and a voice for my community I will not be silenced, controlled or treated like a piece of property. There is no amount of money worth my dignity or my integrity. I have loved hosting AMERICAS GOT TALENT for the last 8 seasons, watching talented, brave, and courageous Americans accomplish their dreams in front of millions has been nothing but a joy, and everyone has been a pleasure to work with but my soul won’t allow me to be in business with corporations that attempt to frown on freedom of speech, censor artists, and question cultural choices.”

Nina Dobrev and Orlando Bloom caused the Internet to have a freakout when they were spotted leaving The Promise premiere in LA together on Thursday, Apr. 12.

The actress has been having a ball at the music festival in Indio, CA this weekend too, but without Orlando. These two are definitely keeping things on the down low and casual!

Orlando just got out of his one-year relationship with singer Katy Perry, 32, in Feb. 2017. He told Elle UK that even though they split up, things did not end badly between them. “We’re all grown up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don’t think anybody cares about what I’m up to. Nor should they. It’s between us. It’s better to set an example for kids and show that [breakups] don’t have to be about hate,” he told the mag. “We’re friends, it’s good.” Sounds like Orlando is ready to move on.

The newlyweds each lambasted a Star Magazine story claiming they had broken up, and that Vergara cheated on him. A recent cover of the publication featured a photo of Vergara dancing with another man with the headline “It’s Over!”

The image showed Vergara without her wedding ring — but both the “Modern Family” actress and her husband say the picture was photoshopped.

“Big surprise everyone but Star created a fake story and then photo shopped my wife’s engagement ring off of her finger in order to sell magazines,” Manganiello, 40, wrote in a heated Instagram post. “They are run by malicious trash. Do the world a favor and don’t buy their garbage.”

Joe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara each blasted a report claiming they had broken up.

Meanwhile, Vergara, 44, shared a similar sentiment while contending that an unedited version of the photo on the cover — which shows Vergara dancing with another man — is on social media which proves she was indeed wearing a ring that night.

“The editor of this magazine is an idiot if he is going to have my ring removed to created a ‘fake’ ‘news’ he should have made sure that he removed from social media all the other pictures of that award night in Rome where Im wearing it,” she wrote in her own Instagram post.

She went on to say that the man she’s dancing with in that photo is a producer working on her upcoming suspense thriller, “Bent,” who spent Easter at her home last month.

A spokesperson for American Media, Inc., which publishes Star, refuted Vergara’s allegation that they photoshopped a photo of her to remove a ring.

“Although Ms. Vergara has claimed that Star removed her wedding ring from a photograph on its cover that was taken during “that award night in Rome,” the photograph in which Ms. Vergara is pictured without her wedding ring was taken in Los Angeles on April 15, after she returned from Rome, and appears on page 34 of the magazine,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

As fans of KUWK may already know, it has become apparent for a while that the 19-year-old is stealing her style and Kourt is convinced it is all Scott’s doing!

One insider explained that ‘Kourtney’s definitely more than a little creeped out by how Sofia appears to be stealing her look. But, it also makes her sad because she realized how young and impressionable Sofia is.’

The source went on to say that the mother of three suspects Scott is to blame for Sofia’s drastic physical change ever since she started dating him.

‘Kourtney thinks she is probably being controlled, or at the very least, manipulated, by Scott. Some people might find it flattering, but she just thinks it’s gross, and Scott needs to grow up, move on, and start living as an independent adult for once.’

As you may remember, at the beginning of Scott and Sofia’s relationship, the teen was rocking her blonde hair and was wearing pretty colorful clothes.

Now, however, not only did she dye her hair brunette but her wardrobe consists of mainly dark blazers and crop tops as well as very thin sunglasses.

Fans of KUWK know that all of these style elements are staples of Kourtney’s fashion.

-6621065312,Terry Crews slams former National Enquirer editor accused of sexual assault for threatening him with false story,"Terry Crews doubled down on accusations that Radar Online threatened him with a false story in the wake of its editor being accused of sexual harassment.

As previously reported, it’s been revealed that Dylan Howard was investigated in 2012 over accusations for sexual harassment in the workplace. American Media Inc., which runs the sites Howard works for, conducted its own investigation at the time via a third party and welcomed Howard back to the company after deeming the accusations baseless - a claim which his accusers contest. Still, Crews went after Howard on Twitter bringing up a recent email he received for a story that never went to print.

“The same guy who runs @radar_online and @NatEnquirer who threatened me with the false prostitute story 1 day after my @GMA interview now accused of SEXUAL MISCONDUCT,” he wrote on Twitter with a link to the story. “ABUSERS PROTECT ABUSERS.”

Crews was referencing a tweet he posted in mid-November in which he shared a screenshot of an alleged email from RadarOnline asking him to comment on a story about him hiring two prostitutes while he was in Monte-Carlo, Monaco in 2015. Crews believes the story was a threat to silence him after he spoke on “Good Morning America” about his sexual assault experience involving his former WME manager, Adam Venit. The story was never published on RadarOnline, which Crews attributes to the fact that it’s untrue.

Crews response happens to come on the same day that Deadline reports he filed an official lawsuit against Venit for sexual assault.

“It is now time to hold Venit accountable for his sexual predatory behavior and to hold WME accountable for its conduct in condoning, ratifying, and encouraging Venit’s sexual predatory behavior,” the Brooklyn Nine-Nine star said in a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Cour. “Indeed, a message needs to be sent to those in power who abuses those over whom they can exert influence and control that abuse and sexual predatory behavior will not be tolerated.”",fake

Caitlyn Jenner dropped a major bombshell when she revealed that she underwent gender reassignment surgery. HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVE details inside how she kept it a secret from her family and stayed reclusive in her healing process.

She did it! Caitlyn Jenner made the final step towards becoming a woman by undergoing gender reassignment surgery and she did it with super secrecy.“Caitlyn was very private and reclusive after her reassignment surgery. It was something that she had been thinking about for a long time and she wanted her body to heal after the surgery given the risks of complications,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

The 67-year-old even kept the news of the procedure from her own family members! “For her it was the final stage to becoming a woman and she did not really discuss it with her immediate family. Caitlyn had fully talked about the procedure with her doctors and her other transgender friends, so, she fully knew what was involved and was totally prepared,” our insider adds.

The former reality star reveals in her upcoming memoir that, “You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.” While she doesn’t go into in-depth detail, the former Olympian says that having a penis had “no special gifts or use for me…I just want to have all the right parts. I am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time.”

She had the surgery in Jan. 2017 and decided to share the news “so all of you can stop staring,” and says that she feels “not only wonderful but liberated. The stunning star revealed her new identity as “Caitlyn” in June 2015, appearing on the cover of Vanity Fair in a white corset. Then, in Oct. 2016, she legally changed her name to “Caitlyn Marie,” as well as her gender to female. Now her transformation is complete!

HollywoodLifers, are you surprised that Caitlyn decided to reveal her surgery to the world?

Kidman told Parade Magazine on Sunday that she and Urban don’t text each other at all – even after their long-lasting marriage. Kidman said they call each other instead.

“We’ve done this since the very beginning. The reason it started at the beginning was because I didn’t know how to text and it just kind of worked for us. So now we don’t,” Kidman told Parade. “We just do voice to voice or skin to skin, as we always say. We talk all the time and we FaceTime but we just don’t text because I feel like texting can be misrepresentative at times.

“And I’ve had the thing where I reread texts and I’m like, “What does that mean?” and then read it to somebody and go ‘Can you interpret that?’ I don’t want that between my lover and I.”

“Once outside, the defendant stood by the front gate and continued yelling profanities,” the officer’s report reads. “I, then again, asked him to leave the area about five times.

Rob and Kristen have reportedly both been approached to star in the same movie, which would be their first joint project since their Twilight days. At lot has happened since then — blossoming careers, other romances, and a very messy, very public breakup. It’s pretty understandable that the actors are both reportedly thinking it over before ever working together again.

“Kristen is more hesitant than Rob right now, but they’ve agreed to discuss it,” an insider told OK! Magazine. “Separately, they’d each jump at it, but working together isn’t an easy yes for them given the fan hysteria that surrounded their split years ago.” If it helps, the unknown movie is described by the source as an “edgy project” that has absolutely nothing in common with the Twilight movies. Rob and Kristen would reportedly be playing roles “far from their Bella and Edward characters.”

And by that, the insider also means no romantic shenanigans between Rob and Kristen. Their characters aren’t “lovers,” according to the source, but they do allegedly have some “close encounters.” To say we’re excited about this hypothetical film would be an understatement. Can you imagine them together again onscreen. A dream come true!

We’re not holding our breath for a romantic reunion, though. We’re not dumb! Though Rob’s now single after ending his engagement to FKA Twigs, Kristen’s still with girlfriend Stella Maxwell.

Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?

In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.

?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT

“Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.

But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.

But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.

This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.

Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.

Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.

Sinead Murphy, who founded the company with her husband Adam, told reporters, “They seemed very engaged with the products. Harry was particularly interested in the bath. I wonder if he has witnessed bath time with his nephew or niece.”

“As soon as he saw the bum bump [which stops the baby from slipping down] he understood immediately,” she continued. “He said, ‘Oh, non-slip.’ ”

Asked about the significance of Markle’s baby hint, she added, “With an upcoming marriage it’s likely there is going to be an announcement in the next few years. No pressure on the lovely couple!”

O.J. should be interested in the show, a source says, but there’s a snag: Caitlyn has “wanted nothing to do with O.J.” since the NFL star was charged with murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.

Though they haven’t approached her yet, producers are hoping to convince Caitlyn to sign on by pitching it as “an informative, interview-type show,” the source says, in which she introduces

O.J. to the new Caitlyn and asks him probing questions about his ups and downs. “If they do

it right,” says the source, “it would be fascinating.”

And while the public, might be hesitant to watch such a reunion, the producers are convinced plenty of people will tune in to view the show. “Love them or hate them,” says a source, “putting Caitlyn and O.J. in the same room would be must-see TV.”

Kristen Wiig might be sticking her claws into Wonder Woman. According to Deadline, the Bridesmaids star is being considered to play Cheetah, a classic comic-book villain, in the upcoming highly anticipated movie sequel. Wiig, who is mostly known for her comedy chops, would be the adversary to Gal Gadot’s Diana Prince. This time the superhero has skipped ahead in time from World War II to fight crime in the 1980s. Cheetah, who was originally depicted as the alter ego of a socialite, will probably fit right in with Reagan’s America. Though, then again, since this is the Cold War she could suddenly become a Soviet. Patty Jenkins is also returning as the film’s director.",fake

Is it rumored fling Selena Gomez? Find out, right here!

Someone’s not sick of that same old love! Orlando Bloom, 40, has allegedly been pursuing his one-time alleged fling Selena Gomez, 24, according to a source who spoke to Star magazine. After breaking up with girlfriend Katy Perry, 32, at the end of February 2017, Orlando isn’t wasting any time being single; he’s apparently determined to get Selena!

“Orlando began blowing up Selena’s phone the day he and Katy broke up,” the friend told Star magazine. “Orlando doesn’t take Selena’s relationship with The Weeknd seriously. If anything, that makes it more of a challenge.”

Wow! That’s incredibly bold of him! Though she’s had some fun times in the past with Orlando, Selena is head over heels in love with The Weekend; she definitely wouldn’t appreciate that line of thinking! In fact, the couple are practically inseparable, a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Selena joined her beau in Europe for a fun romp between tour dates, and then cheered him on at a few concerts. When she headed back to the US, being apart “feels like agony,” the source said!

They’re so into each other that they’ve worked on new music together while they were in Europe. At least one of those songs is a majorly sexy love song, a separate source told us EXCLUSIVELY!

-6414164506,Chris Brown Slammed By Judge For Skipping Karrueche Tran Court Hearing,"Initially, the judge the was inclined to agree. But Brown’s legal team apparently failed to recognize this was a joint hearing with LaCour, who was in the court room ready to testify. “What they didn’t take into consideration was the other case,” one person who was at the hearing tells Gossip Cop exclusively. We’re told Brown’s attorneys “came swooping into court” expecting to get off easy on the technicality with Trans’ absence, but the judge pointed out that Brown “didn’t show up either,” despite another petitioner “ready to go.”

Gossip Cop hears Brown’s attorney tried to argue he had not been served in the cases, but evidence was presented to show he was properly served the restraining orders for both Tran and LaCour. Upon seeing that, “his lawyers began to struggle because they had no clue” about the second case, we’re told, and were not prepared to argue it. Furthermore, the judge accused his side of making a “mockery” of the court. He granted their request for a continuance but demanded Brown appear at the next hearing, which is slated for June 15.

And in an indication of how seriously the judge is taking these matters, the next hearing will be an evidentiary one, in which both sides must present evidence regarding the allegations. It’s also worth noting that Brown’s lead attorney, Mark Geragos, wasn’t even the one who represented him on Tuesday. Rather, a female lawyer was sent in his place. Last month, Tran’s manager slammed Geragos for accusing her of making up the domestic violence allegations for self-promotion. Gossip Cop will continue to have updates.",fake

-6414772244,Blac Chyna Says Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's New Baby Is a 'Blessing',"It’s no secret that Blac Chyna and the Kardashian family don’t get along very well. But despite all of the messiness, it appears as though Blac Chyna is happy for Kim and Kanye’s new baby—even though Chyna sued Kim Kardashian for “destroying her career.”

The messiness goes as far back as when Kylie Jenner used to date Tyga—Chyna was Tyga’s ex, with whom she has a child, and reports of Kylie and Tyga stepping out together started surfacing uncomfortably close to when Tyga and Chyna broke up. It created a tense situation for everyone involved. In 2016, Chyna began dating Rob Kardashian and soon became pregnant. The Kardashian family seemed to try and mostly succeeded in warming up to her.

Less than a year after their child was born, the couple broke up after Rob publicly posted revenge porn photos of Blac Chyna on his Instagram and Twitter. They promptly separated, but ever since then the two families have been embroiled in a tense legal battle that revolved around Chyna suing the Kardshains for “destroying her career so she would not compete with them.” In November, Blac Chyna removed every Kardashian from her lawsuit over her and Rob’s canceled reality show except Kim, Rob, and Kris Jenner.

But today, photographers from The Blast spotted Chyna running some errands in Los Angeles and decided to ask her if she has any feelings about Kim and Kanye’s new baby, who was born via surrogate earlier this week. Chyna’s response was much kinder and more subdued than some might have predicted.

""Are you happy about Kim and Kanye having a kid? A baby girl,” the reporter asked. Chyna smiled and responded, “It’s always a blessing.” She then said something else, which The Blast reported as: “They deserve blessings.” However, it’s hard to hear exactly what she says. E! News reported her as saying “babies are blessings.”

The legal case between Chyna and Rob is still ongoing.",fake
-6374309586,Taylor Swift rips off dress in controversial new music video,"Just after winning Female Artist of the Year at the iHeartRadio Music Awards, Taylor Swift dropped a new music video for “Delicate,” a track from her latest album, “Reputation.”

Like much of the album, the song hones in on Swift’s public perception over the past year or so.

The video opens with a vacant-looking Swift on the red carpet, dressed in a flapper-inspired sapphire gown and mobbed by reporters and photographers.

She escapes to her dressing room, where the songstress makes funny faces at herself in the mirror. She’s interrupted by a group of women, and when she turns back to the mirror, she realizes she can’t see her reflection anymore.

This realization sets off a string of impromptu “La La Land”-esque dance moves — some of which are painfully awkward to watch.

About a minute and a half in, things get crazy: The singer whips off the bottom of her gown, revealing a sassy, shorter version of her fringy frock.

The weird dance moves and the dramatic disrobing aren’t even the most buzzed-about bits of the video, though. Critics say Swift’s video is a ripoff of Spike Jonze’s 2016 Kenzo commercial (starring “The Leftovers” actress Margaret Qualley).

“Anybody else notice that the @taylorswift13 ‘Delicate’ music video ripped off Spike Jonze’s Kenzo video? It’s almost beat-for-beat, just with worse dancing,” one whistleblower tweets.

“Taylor Swift’s ‘Delicate’ video is a poor man’s version of Spike Jonze’s ad for Kenzo,” tweets another.

Naturally, Swift’s die-hard fans couldn’t care less about the Kenzo controversy.

“@taylorswift13 dancing in a storm in her best dress because she’s fearless and it doesn’t get better than this in the ‘Delicate’ video is everything,” tweets a loyalist.",fake

For example, outgoing Jamie loves the nightlife, while Katie is “more of a homebody, and nightclubbing isn’t her thing.” The insider adds, “She’d much rather be sitting at home, reading a book and spending time with [her daughter] Suri.”

It’s not that Jamie’s friends dislike Katie, the source says. It’s just that they think she’s too straitlaced for him. And that’s reflected in her look and style: “They joke that Katie needs a makeover!”

The Oscar winner recently confided in his friends about his plans to marry Katie and start a family with her. “This is a dream come true for Katie. For years, she has wanted Jamie to be her husband and has wanted to give her daughter, Suri, a brother or sister — and now Jamie’s ready to give that all to her,” a second source previously shared of the couple, who’ve attempted to hide their relationship for four years. “Now she feels like all their time spent hiding was well worth it.”

During her trip, the 35-year-old was gifted with a stuffed animal that was designed for newborns. Since her children — four-year-old Prince George and two-year-old Princess Charlotte — are already too old for the toy, she reportedly told her hubby, “We will just have to have more babies.”

But William did not think her joke was funny and later that day, they were spotted having a very tense argument because they disagree on expanding their family. “Tension has been simmering for some time,” says a royal insider, “and it came to the surface under the pressure of a royal tour.”

Kate has her heart set on having at least one more baby, because, “Coming from a family of three herself, she thinks it’s the perfect number,” says the insider, but William is not on the same page. “He’s quite happy with a boy and a girl.”

At the moment, George and Charlotte are “are both at ages where they can’t sit still so they run around all over the place,” says a source. And even though the couple can afford nannies to help care for their children, they “are determined to be hands-on parents” which can be an overwhelming experience.

Kate opened up about her own struggles with adjusting to motherhood back in March during a speech she gave in order to raise awareness of mental health issues in mothers. “Personally, becoming a mother has been such a rewarding and wonderful experience,” she said at the time, according to the Huffington Post. “However, at times it has also been a huge challenge, even for me who has support at home that most mothers do not.”

-6390608108,The American Idol Reboot Is in Jeopardy of Being Canceled,"The show might not go on after all! The American Idol reboot is in jeopardy of being canceled because ratings aren’t exactly what the network had hoped for. A source exclusively told In Touch, “Many believe it has to do with the sexual misconduct allegations against Ryan Seacrest.”

Ryan has vehemently denied the accusations against him made by a former stylist who claimed that he would grind his erect penis against her while in his underwear, groped her, and slapped her buttocks. He has since been cleared by NBC, yet his reputation still seems to be a bit tarnished.

And Ryan is not the only one contributing to the show’s questionable future. Celebrity judge Katy Perry — who was paid $25 million for the gig — has also been a big factor as “her flirty behavior with contestants is a turnoff and key element of the ratings decline.”

The “Firework” singer recently planted a smooch on the hopeful contestant, Benjamin Glaze, who had never been kissed before. The source said that particular kiss, “was met with disapproval.” He publicly spoke about the incident with The New York Times and said, “I was a tad bit uncomfortable. I wanted to save it for my first relationship. I wanted it to be special.” Aside from the Katy drama, the source revealed that the other two judges — Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan — are just “bland.”

So what’s in store for the singing competition? The source said, “There are already whispers of a cancellation or a shake-up in the judging panel. Everyone is panicking because the rebooted Idol just isn’t the lightning-rod hit ABC thought it would be.” The reboot premiered on March 11 and lost 3 million viewers by March 19.",fake

-6397975184,London and Birmingham,"Scalp MicroPigmentation (SMP) is NOT a tattoo, it is a specialist skin pigmentation treatment that is directly applied to the upper dermis of the scalp. HIS Hair Clinic is not a tattoo parlour or tattoo studio, we are a professional hair clinic and the world’s first Scalp MicroPigmentation company to specialise in this innovative hair loss treatment.

As with all great inventions other people try to copy what we do; unfortunately for them HIS Hair remains the global leader and most experienced company for this type of hair loss treatment.

What is the difference between a tattoo and SMP?

The main difference between a tattoo and SMP is that SMP is more semi-permanent and uses a completely natural pigment. SMP uses specialist pigments created for the scalp, not general tattoo inks.

Touch-ups maybe necessary after say 5 to 10 years because SMP is not as permanent as a tattoo.

We are often asked by potential clients from the Muslim community if it’s OK for them to undergo SMP. Naturally they are concerned because they think SMP is a tattoo. The most important advice we give to every individual is that they MUST interpret their understanding of their religious beliefs. However, as far as we are concerned, SMP is NOT a tattoo and we are NOT tattoo artists. We are artistic hair loss specialists and we were the first clinic to set up a dedicated SMP clinic in the Middle East.

A local Imam said: “There is nothing wrong for you to have SMP because it is considered as a treatment of ailment and especially as the treatment is temporary. Baldness is like any other ailment, you are allowed to use any treatment to cure it whether that is colouring or hair planting.”",fake

“Sofia wants to be Kourtney 2.0,” an insider tells In Touch exclusively. “She’s determined to hold on to Scott. What better way to do that than to become the woman he’ll never stop loving?” That may sound totally weird, but Scott, 34, is actually into it, according to the source. She’s willing to stop at nothing to make this happen, including dressing like the reality star. “It’s like she raided Kourt’s closet!”

“Of course, there’s one person who finds it completely immature and laughable: Kourtney,” continued the insider. How could you blame her? However, it sounds like Kourtney is taking the high road and not causing any drama over it. “She likes Sofia — she really has nothing against her — but she does think of her as a kid, a teenager, which she is.”

One thing Kourtney isn’t okay with is the fact that her baby daddy’s teen girlfriend is trying to play mommy to her three kids. “[Kourtney] doesn’t love that Sofia is spending time with her kids,” says an insider. Let’s hope Sofia gives the mom enough space to avoid some major drama!

In the wake of her death, celebrities paid tribute to the actress on social media, mourning the seven-time Emmy winner with a series of heartfelt posts.

“A great lady I loved and owe so much to has left us,” wrote her former co-star Ed Asner. “I will miss her. I will never be able to repay her for the blessings that she gave me.”

In a statement to EW, Moore’s costar from 1967’s Thoroughly Modern Millie, Julie Andrews, called her a “very dear friend.”

“We bonded instantly on the film,” Andrews said, “and laughed our way through the production. Ever since that time, we never referred to each other again as Julie and Mary. Whenever we bumped into each other, people must have thought us nuts…screaming across some shopping aisle in a supermarket or yelling to each other down the corridors of CBS…’Millie! Miss Dorothy!'”

“She was a joy to work with, her talent was monumental. She was brave, kind, generous and an activist for many causes,” Andrews continued. “I will miss my ‘Miss Dorothy’ so much, but I’m comforted to know that the joy she brought us all will be everpresent in her many films and television shows.”

Since ‘The Voice’ nabbed some big-time ‘American Idol’ alums for upcoming seasons, ABC is looking to retaliate and get OG ‘Voice’ coach, Christina Aguilera, for its judging panel, HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned! The battle is ON!

Jennifer Hudson and Kelly Clarkson are two of American Idol’s most famous alumni…but they won’t be on the show’s judging panel when it returns to ABC next year. That’s because both women are already booked as coaches on The Voice for seasons 13 and 14, respectively. So, now, Idol is going after Christina Aguilera, who’s worked for six seasons on The Voice, as revenge. “ABC is ready to make a serious offer to steal Christina from The Voice,” an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “They are looking to pay Christina a lot and sell the fact to her that The Voice has forgotten about her. Idol is very much ready to make the move and hopes Christina bites.”

Christina was one of the original coaches on The Voice, and served on the first three seasons before taking a break during season 4. She returned for seasons 5, 8 and, finally, season 10, when her contestant, Alisan Porter, was named the winner. After that, the powerful singer took some time off to work on her own music, and since J.Hud, Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Miley Cyrus have already been confirmed for the upcoming season 13, we know she won’t be back then, either. So far, the fourth coach who will join Kelly, Adam and Blake on season 14 has not been announced.

No American Idol judges have been confirmed just yet, although HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY heard that Katy Perry is very close to signing a deal. The show is also eyeing alums like Chris Daughtry, Fantasia and Carrie Underwood for the reboot, which will premiere in the first half of 2018.

Shelton filed suit against Bauer Publishing Company and Bauer Media Group in October 2015 over two articles that In Touch published, claiming that Shelton had cheated on his former wife, Miranda Lambert, and that he was heading to rehab after hitting “rock bottom.”

“Blake Shelton has had enough,” the lawsuit read.

Shelton’s complaint noted that the singer was prepared to let the first story, that he cheated on Lambert go, but then the rehab story was published.

“Mr. Shelton is not in rehab and has no plans to go to rehab, which Bauer would have known had it bothered to contact any of Mr. Shelton’s representatives prior to publication of its misleading Rehab Story,” the lawsuit read.

Alleging libel per se and false light invasion of privacy, Shelton’s lawsuit sought damages “not to be less than” $2 million.

-6305593235,Brad Pitt Is Heading To Court Next Month For Custody Agreement With Angelina Jolie,"An end to the custody war between Angelina Jolie and her estranged husband, Brad Pitt, is reportedly near.

A new story that has been published in Life and Style magazine claims that Mr. Pitt and the mother of his children will be in court in February.

The report states that after a bitter fight in the media over Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9, the former couple has reached a custody agreement.

The insider, who spoke to the publication, revealed: “Brad and Angelina are near an amicable agreement with the kids. They are now in a better place than they have been in a long time and should be settling their divorce and custody agreement by sometime in February.”

The former couple announced their divorce in late 2016. It was claimed that Jolie pulled the split trigger after Pitt got into an argument with Maddox.

However, a source told Us Weekly that Pitt is an excellent father who is dedicated to his little clan.

The person in the know shared: “like to spend more time with them than he does, when he is with his children, his children, he prefers to keep things very private and safe. He wants to protect the kids as much as possible and not open them up to public scrutiny.”

According to another insider, Pitt disagrees with Jolie on how to raise their children, and it drew them apart.

The family friend had the following to say: “Brad and Angelina have been at war over how to raise and educate their many children. Angelina keeps dragging the kids to red carpets, award shows, and extravagant trips around the world while Brad has been doing the complete opposite. While Angelina treats the children like her best friends and takes them on dates to her award show appearances, Brad has been trying to instill in his children the wholesome, humble, midwest values he grew up learning.”

The individual concluded by: “Every time Brad sees another picture in the press of Angelina and the kids, he quietly fumes while and he doubles his energy to provide the children with a quiet, peaceful, normal life.”

An ""insider"" allegedly told IB Times, ""The past few years, Ryan's been working out of town while Blake stays home with the kids. The distance between them has taken its toll."" The gossip site tweeted, ""Ryan Reynolds and wife Blake Lively struggling to spend 'quality time'"" together.

And Reynolds' response to this report? ""I wish. I could use a little 'me time'.""

As per usual, Reynolds is ready to tease his wife on social media, which suggests that their marriage is more than fine.

Reynolds and Lively have a long history of trolling one another, and their constant joking appears to help keep their relationship alive.

But, perhaps the couple's sweetest online moment, was when Reynolds was photographed with Lively for the Humans of New York Instagram account. Explaining why their marriage worked, Reynolds revealed:

""She always responds with empathy. She meets anger with empathy. She meets hate with empathy. She'll take the time to imagine what happened to a person when they were five or six years old. And she's made me a more empathetic person. I had a very fractured relationship with my father. Before he died, she made me remember things I didn't want to remember. She made me remember the good times.""

-6311252532,Lindsay Lohan: I Was ‘Racially Profiled’ at the Airport for Wearing a Headscarf,"Lindsay Lohan says she was “racially profiled” at London’s Heathrow Airport after flying in from Turkey because she was wearing a headscarf.

The Mean Girls actress, 30, said she was stopped by a woman who asked her to take her headscarf off. “She opened my passport and saw Lindsay Lohan and started immediately apologizing, but then said ‘But please take off your headscarf,'” Lohan told U.K. television show Good Morning Britain. She added: “And I did, it’s okay. But what scared me was in that moment — how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?”

Lohan, who has been photographed carrying a Koran and says she finds “solace” studying the Muslim holy book, said she didn’t know why she was asked to take her headscarf off but found the experience “really jarring.” She told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: “I’m from New York — I’m born and raised there, but I was a little intimidated.”

When Reid asked the Parent Trap star why she was wearing the headscarf, she said it was “out of respect” for the Turkish women she had met with on her trip. “I was… leaving Turkey and… when I see certain people I feel more comfortable acting the same way as the other women — that’s just a personal respect issue for me that I have,” she said.

When Morgan asked Lohan about her views on President Donald Trump, Lohan said she thought he should be given a fair chance. “I don’t agree with his policies and the things he is doing,” she said. “But at the end of the day he is the president right now. So what’s the point of picking on someone instead of seeing what they’re capable — or not capable — of.” However, she added that she did think his Twitter account should be taken away “or deleted.” Watch the clip below:",fake

It’s been almost two months since she split from her ex-boyfriend The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) and even though they’ve both moved on, there’s one major thing that the former couple is still fighting about — the dog that they adopted while they were still together! Sources exclusively reveal to Life & Style that Sel thinks she should keep their Cavalier King Charles Spaniel pup, Charlie, “and so does Abel.”

“Selena is angry,” says the source, “because she feels like it was more of a gift from Abel to her than a mutually adopted pet, so she’s determined to keep it.”

Back in September — just one month before their split — Selena, 25, and Abel, 27, were spotted together at an NYC pet shop and they seemed to have picked out the puppy together. It also seemed like they shared custody of the pup even though Selena is the only one who had been spotted with Charlie in public. But it seems like Abel has grown attached to Charlie too, and he shared photos of the adorable dog on his Instagram story before their split.

Selena got Charlie just days after she announced that she had spent the summer recovering from a kidney transplant as a result of her battle with lupus, so it seems like Charlie helped her get through that health scare. But now that she’s feeling better, Sel is getting back to work on an untitled project with controversial filmmaker Woody Allen and that’s why Abel thinks he should be the one to have custody of Charlie.

“He thinks Selena won’t be able to take care of Charlie as well as he will because of her schedule,” the source says, adding that Selena isn’t listening — and she won’t give up Charlie without a fight. “She is in love with her puppy.”

The pair spent about two hours enjoying dinner and drinks at Soho House and arrived and left together in Martin's car.

-6255257999,Does Caitlyn Jenner Have A Blonde Girlfriend? New Report Claims She’s Dating Again,"Maybe blondes do have more fun! Caitlyn Jenner was spotted leaving hotspot restaurant Craig’s with a much younger light-haired lady, who a recent report claims is the reality star’s new girlfriend.

Is Caitlyn Jenner, 67, dating again?! The former KUWTK reality star was spotted out in Los Angeles with a young blonde lady on the night of June 22. The mystery woman, who appears to be at least 20 years younger than Caitlyn, is believed to be her new girlfriend, according to MTO News. The pair enjoyed a nice dinner together at West Hollywood hotspot restaurant Craig’s, a popular watering hole for photographers and reporters — so it kinda’ seems like Caitlyn wanted to be seen in public with this blondie. The former Olympian sat in the driver’s seat with her rumored GF by her side as she drove off.

Believe it or not, this actually isn’t the first supposed date Caitlyn’s been on with this lady, according to the publication. They reportedly were seen out together last month in Malibu right around Mother’s Day. When it comes to dating, the transgender icon formally known as Bruce Jenner has been open from the beginning about her disinterest in gender specifications. In matters of love she doesn’t seem to mind if she’s romancing a guy or a girl, or what their biological makeup is. Back in July, she enjoyed a late-night dinner with a mystery man in the UK. It looked like a hot date because Caitlyn rocked a gorgeous white dress and high heels.

But then, fast forward a few months later, Caitlyn reportedly “held hands” with 25-year old Andreja Pejic, an Australian model who completed her transition into womanhood in 2013. The ladies walked the red carpet together at an Oscars after-party and flaunted some mild PDA at the bar, according to Us Weekly. Regardless of who Caitlyn is dating, we’re just happy that she’s comfortable in her skin!

But we’ve never actually seen the daughter and son of Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. On a recent podcast, Kutcher explained why.

“My wife and I have chosen a career where we’re in the public light, but my kids have not,” Ashton told Arianna Huffington on The Thrive Global Podcast. “I think they should have the right to choose that and I actually don’t think that they should have images of them as children that are out there, that somebody could potentially blackmail them with. It’s their private life; it’s not mine to give away.”

He did almost give it away at the beginning. Shortly after Wyatt’s birth in 2014, he shared several photos of different babies, refusing to identify which one was his daughter.

“Mila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world. May your life be filled with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy,” he wrote in the post. “Can you guess which one is ours, or does it really matter? All babies are cute.”

Kutcher and Kunis aren’t alone in their decision to shield their children from the public eye. Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell are also known for keeping their kids off social media. And outside of the celebrity circuit, plenty of parents choose to keep their Facebook feeds child-free.

Harry Styles, 23, is having what’s sure to be one of the best weeks of his life…and HollywoodLife.com is naming him our Star of the Week because of it. The first reason, of course, is because of the release of his very first solo album, Harry Styles. Just a month and a half after he announced he’d be putting out solo music, Harry dropped his debut record, and it immediately soared to the top of the charts. Fans are going completely crazy over the album’s ten songs, and we couldn’t be prouder of the 23-year-old!

Aside from putting out a record, Harry also started doing solo public appearances to promote the music. Fans started lining up for his Today Show concert almost TWO full days in advance, and the crowd went on for SIX New York City blocks when he took the stage on May 9. Harry looked hotter than ever while performing “Sign of the Times,” “Carolina” and “Ever Since New York” for the crowd, and he totally proved he can own that stage, even without his One Direction band mates.

Obviously, it’s been a totally hectic few days for Harry — he was in New York for the first half of the week, then jetted back to London for the album release. Still, he’s made sure to stop and spend time with his fans, posing for selfies and chatting with his loyal supporters. He even sweetly sent pizza out to those waiting in the Today show line all night long. How cute is that?!

Things aren’t slowing down for Harry any time soon, either. He’ll be promoting his music for the next few weeks, and then his first movie, Dunkirk, is set to hit theaters on July 21. After the press run for that is over, he’ll have to start prepping for his tour in the fall. That tour, by the way, sold out in SECONDS when the tickets went on sale last week. GO HARRY GO!

The two actors “have been close for years,” an insider tells the magazine, adding that “they’ve always had a great connection, but one of them was always with someone else, so it stayed platonic.” However, both of them aren’t currently seeing anyone now. “Now that they’re both single, the door is open for them to give this a real shot,” the source continued.

However, this wouldn’t be the first time Justin was “caught” talking to an ex. We recently reported that he spent Thanksgiving with his childhood sweetheart, Caitlin Beadles. The news shocked everyone, leading many to question how serious Justin and Selena really are. Turns out, Justin and Caitlin stayed in touch throughout the years, and Justin is super close with Caitlin’s brother, Christian Beadles. Maybe just like Kourtney, Caitlin is just a permanent fixture in his life! Nevertheless, all is well in the world of love!

An insider has revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY how Brad feels about reconciling with his estranged wife.

Though an insider previously revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Angelina Jolie, 42, “definitely has regrets” about breaking off her marriage to Brad Pitt, 53, that same source said that it’s “really not likely” they will get back together. “Brad’s over it and he believes Angelina crossed the line when she accused him of being abusive towards the kids — as far as Brad’s concerned there’s no way of going back from that,” the insider said.

The source backed up previous reports that at the time of their split, things were “really bad between them” and they had been “fighting a lot.” But the good that has come out of the split is the wake up call Brad got that made him get a new lease on life and a desire to be a better father. “Brad’s done a lot of soul searching over the past few months, he’s quit drinking and he’s really cleaned up his act,” the insider said. The source said that while Angie does miss Brad terribly, she is “a really stubborn person” and wouldn’t admit she’s made a mistake. However, “if Brad came crawling back to her and begged for another chance, she would willingly drop the divorce.” But like the insider said, that’s just not what Brad wants anymore.

Right now both parents seem to be focused on their little ones more than anything else. They have each been spending quality time with them, and there has been loads of birthday fun, seeing as Shiloh, 11, Maddox, 16, and nine-year-old twins, Vivienne and Knox, have birthdays that aren’t too far apart! So among the divorce drama, there has been a lot of happy celebrating! Click here to see pics of Brad and the kids.

She wants to protect herself, and for all her faults nobody could blame her.”

The news comes as Paris celebrates her birthday on Wednesday, though she has yet to mark the occasion with a social media post.

Before tackling her first film project, Paris flexed her acting muscles on the set of Lee Daniels' Star, playing a chic and intimidating social media guru on the set of a publicity shoot.

""This role is really opposite to me,"" she said in a preview of the episode. ""And for it being my first real on-camera acting, I think it's a good way for me to show my acting capabilities.""

Paris also recently signed a contract with IMG Models and seems to have struck up a friendship with fellow model Kendall Jenner. The pals were spotted out shopping together at a flea market in March.

We review every new product, track cool new trends (have you seen this unicorn-inspired makeup?) and snoop inside celebrities’ medicine cabinets whenever possible. So we can freely admit that whenever we take a trip to Sephora or Ulta we inevitably leave with a few more products than we anticipated buying. If you’re guilty too, it’s actually not all that unusual.

According to a new video by Money (above), the average woman will spend $43 on a shopping trip for makeup. (Our bank accounts may not thank us, but our vanities sure do.)

What really gave us a shock, though, was discovering that a woman spends $15,000 on beauty products in her lifetime. That’s a lot of lipsticks… or the cash for a used car!

Out of that money, $3,770 is spent on mascara alone (shop our favorite here!). Another $2,750 is allotted to eyeshadows (blue is totally in right now). And $1,780 is dedicated to new lipsticks (these are the celebrity shades we’re loving right now). And that’s not even including all the products you need to buy to keep your beauty tools clean.

The pair gleefully rocked up to early press interviews hand-in-hand and waxed lyrical about one another.

An HBO source confirmed that during filming the duo were ‘inseparable on the set.’

‘The two of them were always joking around and having fun together.’

However over time this friendship has eroded. Once the show went to air in February, the pair’s relationship started to become competitive.

A source told LIFE & STYLE that things turned from that point onwards.

‘The success of Big Little Lies has gone to both of their heads and there’s now a power struggle between the two stars,’ the source revealed.

‘Behind closed doors, their egos are clashing and they bicker over the smallest thing.’

The public were given a glimpse into the ongoing feud at the Emmy Awards in September when Big Little Lies won the Outstanding Limited Series category.

On stage, Reese grabbed the statue and refused to let it go – even when Nicole tried to have a turn holding it.

Tensions were further fuelled after Nicole beat out Reese for the Emmy award in the category of Best Actress In A Limited Series.

‘There seemed to be some tension between Nicole and Reese at the Emmys afterparty,’ says the Insider.

‘There were some icy stares back and forth, kind of checking who was getting most of the attention, which was clearly Nicole.’

Pattinson and Kristen dated for almost five years before calling it quits in 2013.

In an interview with The Sunday Times, Stewart said, ""I didn't talk about my first relationships that went public because I wanted things that are mine to be mine. I hated it that details of my life were being turned into a commodity and peddled around the world.""

Revealing that the public was the ""enemy"", the Personal Shopper actress shared how difficult it was to date Pattinson, and how it helped her come out openly. The 26-year-old said, ""If it didn't seem like a relevant topic, like something that needed help, I would have kept my life private forever. But then I can't walk outside holding somebody's hand, as I'm followed everywhere. ""

""When I was dating Rob, the public was the enemy, and that is no way to live. [Coming out] wasn't this grand statement, 'I was so confused! Now I've realized who I am!' I have not been struggling. It just seemed important and topical,"" she added.

Revealing why she decided to make her sexuality public, Kristen explained, ""Considering I had so many eyes on me, I suddenly realized [my private life] affects a greater number of people than just me. It was an opportunity to surrender a bit of what was mine, to make even one other person feel good about themselves""

The actress is rumoured to be dating Belgian-Irish supermodel Stella Maxwell and the duo have been spotted kissing on numerous occasions. A People Magazine report in December 2016 suggested that the two were dating. A source told the outlet. ""Kristen is dating Stella Maxwell. They are having fun.""

She’s even said to have met up with him last July, prior to being cast on the reality series.

“They’re both on the fun-loving, goofy side, so they got along great,” the source claims.

As interesting as it is that the 29-year-old has a past with a semi-famous actor, it sounds like all this buzz is for nothing.

Related: Celebrity Mugshots See which stars have been behind bars, ranging from Justin Bieber to Reese Witherspoon

The 25-year-old rapper’s attorney Jon Nelson tells Us that his client’s case was quietly resolved in January through plea negotiations. Scott (real name Jacques Webster) pleaded guilty to the lowest charge and was required to pay $640 in court-associated costs, in addition to $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert. The other two misdemeanor charges — inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a child — were dismissed.

“Obviously, [Scott] would not in any way want a riot to break out at his concert. That would not be good for him as an entertainer,” Nelson says. “To think that he incited one is ridiculous. We think the police way overcharged him. The prosecutor’s office finally did the right thing — they made an offer that he agreed to. … If anyone was hurt, Travis expressed concern from the beginning. He wanted to make sure those people were taken care of.”

Speaking with the Express.co.uk, Tracey Cox, a body language and relationships expert and TV presenter, suggested the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are both the “star” in the relationship. Ms Cox said: “There is something about them that is very similar. “Same approach to the world, they both like to have a bit of fun, they very quickly settled in to the appropriate level of affection. “Their body language shows nobody is at the bottom of the relationship and that is because it is an unusual situation with her being a Hollywood celebrity and him being the star.

“Usually there is only one star in the relationship.” When asked how this compares to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s “mannerisms”, Ms Cox said: “Kate very much knows William is the star.” She added: “Her body language shows she is quite subservient to him. “Whereas with Harry and Meghan their body language is completely different.

“I can't see any power struggle, and she has got a level of saying.” Ms Cox explained her claims and suggested the reason why the two Royal couples have got such different relationships is because the pressure is on Prince William, who is third in line to be king. Ms Cox said: “This is why Meghan and Harry can have public display of affection in public while William and Kate tend not to. ""They can be a bit more modern and affectionate.""

The policy, formed under the Obama administration and implemented in 2012 to protect from deportation the nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children, will be rescinded in six months.

After Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the news, the president said in a written statement: “I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are [a] nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.”

While many are protesting at Trump Tower and in D.C., Los Angeles, Denver, and New York City, sharing their outrage and heartbreak over the announcement, others are expressing their grievances on social media, including former President Obama:

“To target these young people is wrong – because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating – because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love,” Obama said in a poignant Facebook post. “And it is cruel. What if our kid’s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her?

A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.

""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""

Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.

""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""

With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.

""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""

Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.

""How do you not know how awesome you are?"" Nicolle Wallace asked.

Since the exciting news of the new royal baby, the Duchess has had all eyes on her, particularly as she is suffering from extreme morning sickness again.

However, it's been reported that Kate Middleton is frustrated that Prince Harry and his American actress girlfriend are ""stealing her limelight"".

The mother of two is allegedly worried that the possibility of an engagement between Harry and Suits star Meghan Markle will overshadow her.

(Image: Getty)

According to The Daily Star: ""The Duchess knows that because of her years of experience in Hollywood, Meghan is more media savvy than Kate will ever be.

""She knows how to work a red carpet and she definitely knows how to pose for a camera in ways that Kate Middleton can only dream of doing herself.

""Forget Queen Elizabeth and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Kate Middleton knows that Meghan Markle will be a real royal threat the moment she officially becomes a member of the British royal family.""

The source continued: ""Kate Middleton can get pregnant with ten royal babies, yet the press will still focus on Harry and Meghan and how perfect they are for each other.

""They are young, their romance is fresh and most importantly, they’ve got a bright future ahead of them. In other words, they are the royal family’s new A-list stars.

""And for Kate, that’s what is troubling her right now. She’s no longer the star of the show.""

Daily Mail reports that the two have met up for dinner dates after meeting in the New York art scene, but Theroux insists they're just friends.

Neither have confirmed, let alone responded to, the dating gossip yet. But Theroux, 46, did previously share a photo with Collins, 25, last month on Instagram. (They also follow each other on the app.) Both wear Adam Selman graphic tees in the faceless post, and Collins is tagged.





Despite the suspicions, details on the two's relationship—platonic or not—remain clouded. However, fans are curious whether the rumored fling has any connection to the fact that Selena Gomez recently unfollowed Collins on Instagram, despite their close friendship. (Collins still follows Gomez, though.)

The pair first met in 2015, when Petra photographed Selena for Wonderland Magazine, and went on to become friends and creative collaborators. Collins directed Gomez's raunchy ""Fetish"" music video, which released last summer, and shot some of her promo photos. Last fall, they even talked about the possibility of writing a movie together. They were last seen in public together during New York Fashion Week last month, according to Elle.

Strangely enough, Theroux also gave a shoutout to Gomez on Instagram. In his first post after announcing his split from Aniston, the actor mentioned the singer in the hashtags: ""#selenagomez #Yeahthatsrightselenaididittoyouagainbutifyousawtheseguysyouddowhateveryoucouldtooalsoiknowyourechilllikethat.""

The $750,000 indie film, ‘‘Safety Not Guaranteed,’’ went on to make $4 million in theaters.

The young director soon found a mentor in Brad Bird, who became famous at Pixar directing ‘‘The Incredibles’’ and ‘‘Ratatouille.’’ Trevorrow started hanging out with Bird on the set of his big-budget George Clooney movie, ‘‘Tomorrowland.’’ Bird called his pal Frank Marshall, a producer of ‘‘Jurassic World,’’ to give him a heads up.

‘‘There is this guy,’’ Bird said, ‘‘that reminds me of me.’’

Marshall was so impressed with Trevorrow that he took him to meet Steven Spielberg. That’s where Trevorrow hit the jackpot: He was tapped to direct and co-write the $150 million ‘‘Jurassic World.’’ The movie went on to make $1.6 billion, and Trevorrow was signed to direct the ninth ‘‘Star Wars.’’

Apparently, the mum-of-two is keen on showing off her new slimmer figure after dropping all of the baby weight she gained before giving birth to her son Saint West.

Instead of going the regular route of a balanced diet and exercise, Kim is said to be 'obsessed' with achieving her goal weight by any means necessary.

The 36-year-old is thought to been motivated to change her shape after unedited photos appeared of her bum while she was on holiday in Mexico last April.

ABC quickly identified and corrected the errors. We apologize to the Academy, press, and fans for any confusion.”

Adams was inadvertently named one of the nominees for best actress for her work as linguist Louise Banks in Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi film “Arrival.” It would have been her sixth Oscar nomination.

Adams was thought to be a shoo-in, but may have seen her support eroded by also being in contention for “Nocturnal Animals.” The actual nominees were Isabelle Huppert for “Elle,” Ruth Negga for “Loving,” Natalie Portman for “Jackie,” Emma Stone for “La La Land,” and Meryl Streep for “Florence Foster Jenkins.”

Bening was incorrectly listed in the same category for the comedy-drama “20th Century Women.” It would have been her fifth nomination.

-5827508224,Report: Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Split,"Are Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes separating? Rumor has it, the ""La La Land"" actor and the ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" actress have been living separate lives for months following the arrival of their second daughter last year.



""They're past the point of caring now. The biggest sign it's over is the fact that Eva and Ryan don't even bother to argue anymore. The only thing they do agree on is the fact that none of their needs are being met!"" says the source.



According to a source, Ryan and Eva's relationship broke up after he chose to celebrate Mother's Day with his mom, Donna, rather than Eva. Their relationship has reportedly been toxic behind closed doors for quite a long time now.



Ryan was devastated when Eva refused to accompany him to the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, despite his Best Actor nods for ""La La Land"", according to sources.



The source claims, ""Everyone's kind of gotten used to Eva shunning the limelight, but no one ever thought for a moment she'd skip the Oscars - especially when Ryan was nominated for a once-in-a-lifetime accolade. It didn't make sense. When they first got together, they were inseparable and were often seen out on dates holding hands. Now that just doesn't happen.""



Eva reportedly refused to accompany Ryan on the annual award shows as she was jealous with his co-star Emma Stone. ""Emma and Ryan have THE hottest chemistry in Hollywood right now. Eva seems to feel totally intimidated by Emma, even though neither Emma nor Ryan have given her any reason to worry,"" shares the source.



""Since Eva bowed out of the public eye, she's like a paranoid hermit, and it's driven a huge wedge between them,"" the source tells Radar Online, ""She'll go weeks without speaking to any other adult except Ryan. It makes for a pretty intense situation. Eva won't go out, and she avoids his family. Even worse, she's convinced she's not Ryan's only one - when she is!""



The source adds, ""Ryan's not a cheating kind of guy and can't stand it when women hit on him. Even worse, he can't stand being accused of something he hasn’t done!""

After all of the hoopla surrounding Zoe Saldana's portrayal of Nina Simone in the controversial Nina biopic, it is safe to assume the actress knows a thing or two about being on the wrong side of a popular opinion. With her expertise on the matter Saldana is back in the headlines for her assessment of how Hollywood treated Donald Trump's presidential victory.

""We got cocky and became arrogant and we also became bullies,"" she explained during an interview with the AFP. ""We were trying to single out a man for all these things he was doing wrong... and that created empathy in a big group of people in America that felt bad for him and that are believing in his promises.""

While Saldana did not speak out in support of the president-elect's highly criticized offensive behavior, her comments were perceived to have been in defense of Trump, and many Twitter users were not here for it.

""I will destroy your happiness, if it is the last thing I do."" —The Evil Queen[src]

The main villain of Snow White the evil queen tries to have Snow White dead so she can be the fairest of them all. The Queen cast a curse in the fairytale world so that no one shall live happily ever after. Her main rival in the series is Maleficent.

In Fairy Tale Land the Evil Queen is a beautiful, terrifying woman who carries herself with awful menace. She is the mortal enemy of Snow White and Prince Charming. Determined to have her vengeance on all the inhabitants of Fairy Tale Land, the Evil Queen is willing to do whatever it takes to destroy their happy endings.

She uses her dark powers to enact a curse on the land, one that sends all of its inhabitants, “somewhere horrible. Absolutely horrible. A place where the only happy ending will be mine.” A place where nobody but the Evil Queen will have any recollection of who they are or how they arrived. A place void of hope. A place that sounds eerily similar to Storybrooke, Maine.

The Victoria's Secret model and rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, had showed off their relationship to the world at the 2017 Met Gala. A source told Hollywood Life: ""Kris doesn't understand why Kendall didn't take her relationship with Harry more seriously. She feels like Kendall threw in the towel too quickly and that if she had persevered, she and Harry would still be an item.""

""Kris is disappointed that Harry is now off the market and dating Tess. Kris would much rather see her daughter with an A-list celeb like Harry, than A$AP [Rocky] who is now embroiled in baby mama rumors.""

""She just doesn't get what Kendall sees in him. She would be thrilled if Kendall was linked to Harry. A new album, a movie, a great reputation, gorgeous, he has it all,"" the insider added.

All proceeds from the annual fundraising event — founded by Miami-based DJ Irie — go towards helping the Irie Foundation provide scholarship opportunities and mentoring programs to at-risk youth living in South Florida.

-573344559,This Video Is Making Fans Think Beyoncé Is Pregnant with Her Fourth Child,"It’s only been a year since Beyoncé broke the internet when she gave birth to not one but two babies with her husband, Jay-Z. But is she already ready for another one? The BeyHive sure think so after the 36-year-old singer was photographed with what fans claim to be a very obvious baby bump.

To prove their theory, many fans are referencing a video from a recent concert on Beyoncé‘s On the Run Tour II with Jay-Z. The video shows Beyoncé in a sparkly white outfit with what fans are confident is a small baby bump sticking out of her midsection.

In addition to Star magazine (a not-so-reliable tabloid, if we’re being honest) reporting that the singer is “over the moon” with her pregnancy, fans are also referencing a tour outfit that they believe is a secret message from Beyoncé herself, proving that she’s pregnant. The outfit, a skin-tight gold dress that Beyoncé pairs with a giant cape, features a heart on her midsection, which many fans believe represents her baby’s heartbeat.Given Bey and Jay-Z’s love for the number four (4:44 is the title of Jay-Z’s last album and their wedding anniversary is on April 4), it makes sense that the couple is expecting their fourth child, as fans have noted. Needless to say, the BeyHive is alive with speculation (and worry that Bey might cancel the rest of her tour to go on maternity leave.)

As excited as we would be for another Beyoncé pregnancy, it’s important to note that neither she nor Jay-Z have confirmed anything. And until they do, all rumors are speculation. Likewise, as Lili Reinhart, Drew Barrymore, Blac Chyna, and dozens of other celebrities who have fought off pregnancy rumors have proven, bloating is a real thing and assuming that someone is pregnant based on how much their stomach resembles a “baby bump” is dangerous and a form of body-shaming.

We get it. A Beyoncé pregnancy would make 2018. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.",fake
-5744952795,Ryan Seacrest Opens Up About Why He's Never Been Engaged,"Though he has yet to tie the knot, Ryan Seacrest thinks about marriage often.

The Live with Kelly and Ryan host, who is currently dating 26-year-old chef and model Shayna Taylor, says he wants to get married one day—he has even admitted that he once came close to proposing to an unnamed ex-girlfriend. But even though the 43-year-old radio personality and producer says he believes in marriage thanks to his parent's long-lasting union, he still has some hesitations, he told co-host Kelly Ripa.

""I've never been engaged, I do believe I would,"" he told Kelly Ripa on their morning show earlier this year. ""I did get close, and I didn't do it and it was the right move, but I love the idea of marriage because my parents have been married for 47 years.""

But despite his admiration of his parents' relationship, he admits he's still reluctant to settle down. ""The truth is, I don't want to screw it up,"" he said. ""And a lot of times, [marriages] get screwed up, so I figured the longer I wait, the older I'll be, the closer to death I am, so I can get it in and not screw it up.""

The talk show host has dated quite a few famous women before—most notably Julianne Hough, Adriana Lima, and Teri Hatcher. But earlier this year, he got back together and moved in with ex-girlfriend Shayna—and he hasn't been shy about gushing over her on Live. Shayna even appeared on the talk show this past fall to share her healthy banana bread recipe with viewers. ""[I'm] proud and excited to have her here,"" Ryan said while introducing her.

And although the couple has denied the affair, Sean’s ex-girlfriend Ariana Grande is not too convinced. “Ariana is not surprised at all that Sean may have been cheating on Jhene with Nicole. Ariana found Sean selfish, narcissistic and self-absorbed while they were dating. Ariana felt like Sean needed a lot of attention from not just her, but from other women too,” a source close to Ariana tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Ouch!

“So, Ariana believes that Sean would be at least flirting with Nicole, if not more, while still in a relationship with Jhene because that is what he did with her too. Ariana believes the rumors about Sean and Nicole, which makes Ariana feel bad for both Sean and Jhene because Sean has not changed. She thinks he can be a dog, and he has a lot of maturing to do still,” the source continued. If you recall, Arianna and Sean dated for eight months back in 2014. They seemed like they were in it for the long haul until Ariana got a little too close to Justin Bieber, 24, on stage at one of her concerts in 2015. So, it’s clear there was drama on both sides.

Despite, Ariana’s concerns, we do have reason to believe Big Sean has changed. The “Bounce Back” rapper responded to a fan’s savage comment regarding his alleged infidelity with, “Well, it’s not true at all. Y’all wasted no time though telling me how much I ain’t s**t tho with no doubt in your mind… cause the internet said so? Thanks for the support. But truly it’s all love only, I have no time to hate or judge anybody!” It looks like he’s taking his relationship with Jhene very seriously, and we couldn’t be happier!",fake

-574466178,Kate Middleton Calls Off Third Pregnancy Plans: Prince William An Absentee Father?,"Kate Middleton is calling off her third pregnancy plans, mostly because Prince William has apparently been an absentee father. The Duchess of Cambridge has made it no secret that she’s unhappy with her current situation at home.

In a new Heads Together clip with Prince William and Prince Harry, Kate Middleton hints that she’s done having children. She struggled so much after the birth of her first child, Prince George. Kate recalled how she wasn’t prepared for all the life changes that come after having your first child. During Kate’s heartfelt confession, William sat next to her in silence.

“Having a child, particularly your first child, is such a life-changing moment,” Kate said in the clip. “Nothing can really prepare you for that. Remember the first few days with little George, you have no idea what really you are doing, no matter how many books you read, nothing can prepare you for it.”

Kate Middleton has made it no secret that she often feels lonely and isolated at home. Clearly, she doesn’t have many close friends to turn to. And, it doesn’t look like Prince William is helping their situation, either. Kate’s supposedly been using a secret account on the popular mom forum Mumset for advice on how to parent her two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, at home.

Often times she finds herself butting heads with her husband simply because of their different backgrounds and upbringings. Simply put, Kate Middleton doesn’t want her children to have the same, stiff royal upbringing that Prince William experienced. She wants to be more hands-on with her children.

But if Kate can’t handle raising two kids on her own, there’s simply no way that she’ll manage three small children under the age of 5. That might be the reason why she’s saying no to a third pregnancy. She doesn’t want to be left alone, angry and frustrated with the struggles of raising small children while her husband goes off on one of his ski trips with his pals.

Then again, the only two people who really know what’s going on behind closed doors are of course the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge themselves. So far Buckingham Palace has not made any comments about Kate Middleton’s future plans. Also, check back with CDL for all the latest news and updates on the royal family right here.

Almost five years to the day Katie Holmes divorced husband Tom Cruise, she made her relationship with Jamie Foxx public. However, her four-year romance with Jamie was not a secret for Tom, who has known about the couple for some time and is not a fan.

Katie, 38, started dating Jamie, 49, shortly after her divorce from Tom, 55, in 2012 but it wasn’t until this week that photos finally surfaced of the couple holding hands while walking on the beach. Tom, on his part, feels stabbed in the back by his former Collateral co-star.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BSbwlWoBrZ7/

“Tom has known about Katie and Jamie’s secret relationship since the beginning and it has always bothered him that they were hooking up. While Katie and Jamie did their best to keep things a secret from the world, Tom is too well-connected and found out about them shortly after their romance began,” a source told Hollywood Life. “Tom is shocked and upset that Katie is dating a costar he once considered a close friend. He feels betrayed by both of them.”

The timing is no coincidence when it comes to Katie’s decision to publicize her romance. According to reports, her divorce contained a clause that did not allow her to publicly date another man for five years after their split.

“Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce,” a source said. “She’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter Suri.”

And the couple is getting serious. Jamie was spotted hanging out Suri, Katie’s 11-year-old daughter with Tom, before her first day of school last month, and Katie is ready to take their relationship to the next level. “Katie is past the point of caring about what Tom thinks about her private life,” an insider told Life & Style exclusively. “She and Jamie are really in love.”",fake

Styles has been putting his foot in the water of country music a lot recently, offering a stellar rendition of Little Big Town's ""Girl Crush"" during a show at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, where Cam was his opening act. He says the track is ""one of my favorite songs recently that's come out of this place,"" meaning Nashville.

He'll also take trailblazer Kacey Musgraves out on the road with him as an opening act during the U.S. dates of his 2018 Live on Tour. Additionally, the pop singer has said that he wants to collaborate with Chris Stapleton, citing himself as a ""massive fan."" He also has a fan in Gretchen Wilson, who praised his 2017 self-titled album, calling it ""something real.""

Twain's latest album, Now, her first studio album release since 2002's massively successful Up!, landed at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Country Albums chart in 2017. The album's second single ""We Got Something They Don't"" is currently on country radio.",fake

-562132594,Selena Gomez Missing Justin Bieber ‘Dearly’ While She’s Away In Europe: They Have A ‘Strong Love’,"Absence makes the heart grow fonder! We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how Selena Gomez is missing Justin Bieber like crazy while she’s away in Europe.

Selena Gomez, 25, is an ocean away from sweetie Justin Bieber, 23, on a trip to London and this is the farthest they’ve been apart since getting back together in late October. While there’s always Facetime, nothing beats the real thing and the singer is missing her honey with all of this distance between them. “Selena has been a bit bummed since her time out of the states and away from Justin. She misses him dearly and the time apart has helped her realize how important he is to her,” a source close to Selena tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

“Selena felt the need to pull back a little but that has only made things more clear in her mind. Selena has a strong love and bond for Justin. She wanted alone time, got it, and it was what she needed. It has helped her learn about herself and how much Justin means to her. She genuinely misses him and is can’t wait to get back to him,” our insider adds.

The “Wolves” singer is in London for the Fashion Awards 2017 on Dec. 4 where she rocked her blonde bob along with a very conservative long sleeved white dress with ruffles that looked like something out of the Old West. She finally admitted to getting back together with Justin in a cover story for Billboard magazine, which just named her Woman of the Year. “I’m 25. I’m not 18, or 19, or 20,” she told the magazine of reconnecting with her ex. “I cherish people who have really impacted my life.”

After her dramatic health scare where she needed a kidney transplant over the summer after coming within two weeks of organ failure, no wonder she”s done a ton of re-evaluating of what she wants now that she has a new lease on life. As her song says, “The Heart Wants What it Wants” and that’s Justin! They’ve both grown so much in their years apart so hopefully this time around their romance will go the distance.

HollywoodLifers, are you glad that Justin and Selena are back together? Or do you think he’ll break her heart again?",fake

She continued to be cast as a supporting character: both conceptually through the nominal determinism of the Jenner sisters' clothing line, Kendall + Kylie, and literally in the Kardashians' E! network spin-offs (Jenner was never a key strategist, but always a loyal supporter as her half-sisters Kourtney and Khloe engaged in military operations to ""take"" Miami, New York, and, their final battle front, The Hamptons).

-5630814357,Blake Shelton Claps Back at Miranda Lambert With Help From Luke Bryan,"



Divorce is never easy… especially when you’re Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert. The country music superstar just clapped back at his ex-wife with a little help from fellow country music singer, Luke Bryan. Buddies Blake and Luke performed a seemingly innocent rendition of George Strait’s “All My Exes Live In Texas” — but considering the fact that Miranda was recently called out for shading her husband, this choice of song hardly seems coincidental.

Luke’s wife, Caroline, posted a photo of her hubby dressed up like Blake for the performance. “Blake Bryan. Luke really wanted to capture the vintage Blake look….but he actually looks like Luke from our college days. #1998 #bluke #crashmyplaya,” she wrote. The singers the performed the song which fans are calling now Blake’s way of subtly shading his ex who is a proud Texas native.

Recently, during Miranda’s Livin’ Like Hippies tour, she performed her fan-favorite hit, “Little Red Wagon,” which references the years she spent married to Blake. During a Greenville, SC, concert last week, she made an unexpected update to the single’s lyrics. The original lyrics are: “Oh, you only love me for my big sunglasses / And my Tony Lomas / I live in Oklahoma,” but in the concert version, Miranda changed the “I live in Oklahoma” line to “I got the hell out of Oklahoma.”

Miranda is originally from Texas but moved to Blake’s home state of Oklahoma when they got married in 2011. After they split in 2015, she moved to Nashville — but clearly hasn’t left her failed marriage in the past. Especially since Blake has remained in Oklahoma where he is frequently spotted around town with his new girlfriend, Gwen Stefani.

Miranda also moved on with boyfriend, Anderson East but is still clearly scarred from her divorce from Blake. “The cold-blooded way Blake blindsided her with divorce, drove her out of his life, and then shoved his romance with Gwen [Stefani] in her face is something that will scar her forever,” an insider exclusively told Life & Style. “It still burns her.”",fake

Sources tell Life & Style exclusively that after a six-week trial separation earlier this year, the famous duo wanted to salvage their relationship by seeking professional help. “Their therapist comes to their home and talks with them,” an insider reveals. “They were considering divorce, but decided to try to work it out. It’s been an uphill battle, but they’ve come a long way.”

The insider adds, “They’re learning how to communicate and understand each other. They have learned to get along again. The therapy is helping, for now.”

One of the things the pair addresses in their sessions is Kanye’s anger issues. “They discuss his different triggers and how Kim can keep him from getting upset at home,” a different source shares.

But while both stars have agreed to stay together, they differ in wanting a third baby. Kim, who has daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 18 months, with Kanye, is desperate to give her kids another sibling. As for Kanye… “He doesn’t want a third child,” the source admits, “but Kim thinks she’s found a way around that.”

The 36-year-old has been searching for a surrogate to carry their frozen embryo. “She wants to choose someone outside of the state of California, where there are all kinds of surrogacy laws,” the source says. “She’s ready to go.”

Kim previously revealed that it would be extremely dangerous for her to get pregnant again, given the complications she experienced during her last two deliveries. “Not only has this been really painful, but now hearing that I can’t carry any more kids, it couldn’t get any worse,” she said on an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.

Although it’s been nearly a month since Chris Pratt, 38, and Anna Faris, 40, announced that they had decided to end their marriage, the wound is still very fresh! These two seemed perfect for each other! Now, as we attempt to move forward, we’re learning new details on how the actress is managing the painful change. And according to our insider, dating is the last thing on her mind! Take a look back at the adorable former couple right here!

“Anna and Chris’ decision to separate was a long-time coming, it wasn’t a rash decision,” a source close to Anna tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “They tried to make it work for a long time, but it just wasn’t doable. They grew apart, and Chris changed a lot as his career became more and more successful; they just found themselves in completely different places and in the end they fell out of love. It’s highly unlikely they will ever get back together again. It was a tough decision to break up, and it took a lot of soul-searching on both sides. But it really was for the best, for them and for their son [Jack Pratt, 5].” Absolutely gut-wrenching.

Our insider went on to add that the Scary Movie star is focusing on taking care of herself and being a good mother during this difficult period. “They really want to keep things as amicable as possible, and hope that once the drama of the divorce is over, they will be able to maybe forge some kind of friendship, but as far as romance is involved, that’s really not in the cards. Right now, Anna has no desire to start dating, she’s totally focused on her son and on healing her heart. She would like to stay single for at least a year so she can regroup and get her head together. Meeting somebody else is really not on the agenda for her, she just needs some ‘me time’ right now.” Totally understandable considering the jarring circumstances.

'[The] next season is going to be very different with new rules,' claims a source who says that the British producer is worried that 'AGT' is turning into a kiddie's talent show.

Oct 5, 2017

AceShowbiz - You may not see kids among ""America's Got Talent"" contestants in next year's season. The show's judge as well as executive producer Simon Cowell reportedly is considering to ban kids from the NBC show.

Naughty Gossip reveals that Simon is worried that ""America's Got Talent"" is turning into a kiddie's talent show, and the fact that this year's winner is 12-year-old singing ventriloquist Darci Lynne is not helping either. ""This year the two finalists were children. Last year's winner [Grace VanderWaal] was a kid too. The fear is that next year no one older than 15 will even bother auditioning,"" the source says.

""The most talented adult in America doesn't stand a chance against a child with a homemade puppet. Now Simon is stepping in to fix the problem,"" the source continues. ""It doesn't take anything away from the folks that have already won, but next season is going to be very different with new rules.""

It remains to be seen how exactly the new season will be different. Previously, Simon said that what he loved about ""America's Got Talent"" is that there were no age limit. ""There are no rules. I applaud the fact that you have paid your dues. You have such a great heart, such a great talent, this has been amazing yet again,"" said the British producer while gushing over season 12 contestant, a subway singer Mike Yung.

Season 12 of the show announced Darci as the winner . 10-singer-old singer Angelica Hale came out as the runner-up while Ukrainian dance troupe Light Balance took the third place. ""I felt so loved during my 'AGT' journey by all the contestants, and all the staff, my friends and family, and everyone…and it just all came out!"" Darci said after bringing home $1 million dollar. ""They made me feel so good that they made me come on the stage. I was overcome with joy, and I was kind of shocked and delirious at that time, so I can't remember anything.""",fake

West celebrated his 41st birthday on Saturday with friends, family, music, a mind-bending mentalist and lattes that had the foam made into an image of his face because, of course.

West's wife, Kim Kardashian, shared videos and pictures from inside the amazing soiree on social media. They show a fun, festive affair, with West looking relaxed and having fun as world-class mentalist Lior Suchard completely destroyed some minds in the room with some spectacular visual illusions, suggestive powers and what looks suspiciously like some legit mind reading and telekinesis.

Suchard bent a spoon rubbing his finger on it and flipped a pair of glasses with what looked like a simple wave of his hand, delighting the ever-living heck out of West and his friends.

The party appeared to have had a cave theme, with moss hanging from the ceiling, low light and a mountain-themed birthday cake. Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner were also in attendance. West looked comfortable holding court, at one point, sitting on a couch and just taking everything in as his music played.

And then, there were those lattes with Kanye's face made into the foam.

Here are just a few photos from the epic event.

It's been an eventful time for the controversial rapper. On Thursday, West debuted a fresh album collaboration with Kid Cudi, Kids See Ghosts. His new solo album Ye, also just obliterated music charts. On the flipside, West is still dealing with the fallout of his controversial statements on slavery and in support of Donald Trump. And he helped stoke more family drama on his new album by rapping about the cheating scandal involving Tristan Thompson. And Donda's House, a charity he co-founded in honor of his late mother, Donda West, to help the youth in Chicago, formally dropped her name because of a dispute over his alleged lack of involvement and interest.

Still, it was good to see West relaxed, comfortable and having a little family fun at his birthday party.

But, as usual, there was one person missing from the celebration – her father, Tom Cruise.

With each passing birthday, sources tell Star magazine, Suri’s heartache grows too.

‘Like any little girl, her greatest wish is for her father to be there, and now she’s been disappointed again,’ a friend told Star.

Star’s report claims the 54-year-old actor hasn’t seen his daughter in 1,965 days, and has ‘been absent for one milestone after another.’

They add, ‘That would be painful for any child, and you have to wonder what kind of emotional toll it’s taking on Suri.’

According to Star, Katie has tried to explain Tom’s absence by telling Suri that her dad’s crazy moviemaking schedule leaves him little time to jet back and forth for visits.

A source said, ‘Now that Suri’s older, that story may not fly anymore.’

Many believe Tom’s inability to see his daughter is due to his fierce commitment to the Church of Scientology, which requires its members to ‘disconnect’ from friends and family who leave the faith.

Psychologist, Dr. Cara Gardenswartz, told Star that Tom’s decision to not see his daughter would be ‘psychologically devastating.’

‘Suri may feel it’s because she’s not good enough,’ Dr. Gardenswartz claims. ‘A child’s experience between 8 and 12 is really going to impact them as a teen and as an adult.

‘They’re figuring out their sexuality, as well as relationships between men and women. Not having a parent around – especially a girl missing her father – can be quite confusing.

The visit was for a routine check-up, and even though she’s a fan of tattoos, this type of needlework is definitely not her favorite. She might be well on her way to conquering the world, but that doesn’t make her immune to irrational fears, not being able to fall asleep at night included.

And added that the rest of Kylie’s older sisters echo Khloe’s feelings. “It’s not just Khloe, all of Kylie’s sisters are encouraging her to take her time as much as she can,” the source explained.

-5407461289,Here's Why Kylie Jenner Decided to Stop Sharing Pictures of Stormi,"Yesterday, Kylie Jenner said she'll no longer be sharing pictures of Stormi's face, and the reason is beyond heartbreaking.

An insider told People that Kylie made the decision because of the ""nasty"" comments she was seeing on pictures of her daughter.

“Kylie felt so protective of her baby when she was pregnant. This is why she didn’t share any bump pictures while she was pregnant. After Stormi was born, Kylie was the proudest mom.”

“She couldn’t wait to show off Stormi to her fans. She posted pictures, because she was so excited to be a mom. Unfortunately, social media is a crazy place. People have been making nasty comments.""

“Kylie is shocked and doesn’t want her daughter’s pictures to be a part of something negative. She might reconsider in the future, but for now, she won’t post any more photos of Stormi’s face.”

On Sunday, Kylie posted the below photo, which showed only part of Stormi's head, and when a commenter called her out on cropping out her daughter, she said ""yeah I cut my baby out. I’m not sharing photos of my girl right now.""



That's when fans noticed that Kylie had gone back and deleted old photos of Stormi, too.



The decision comes amid (very crazy and somewhat rude) rumors that Kylie's baby isn't actually Travis Scott's. In May, people on Instagram started taking pictures of Stormi's face and placing them next to photos of Kylie's former bodyguard Tim Chung, commenting on how similar the two looked. Tim denied the rumor via a statement on social media.

And Kylie did her part when she posted a photo of her and Travis from the Met Gala with the caption ""Stormi's parents.""



So it looks like that settles that, but prepare yourself for a Stormi picture drought with an end date TBD.

Chyna is suing the Kardashian family because she claims they played a role in the cancellation of her E! reality show, Rob & Chyna. However, the family maintains the show ended after she got a restraining order against Rob, making it difficult to film a show about them. Blac Chyna first filed the lawsuit back in October 2017. Just last month, Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian were tentatively dismissed from the case.

It's not completely clear, TMZ notes, why the sisters were added back to the lawsuit. Though, allegedly, shady comments were made about the show by one or both of the women.

As for Kim and Kris, after they were tentatively dismissed, the judge did allow for Blac Chyna to someday create a new case against them in the future, should she want to do that.",fake

""She comes to a ton of games,"" Romo added. ""She's a supportive girlfriend.""

Too supportive, according to the superstitious Cowboys fans who blamed Simpson's presence on the sidelines for a decline in his play, as well as their winter vacation in Mexico for the Cowboys' loss to the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants in their NFC division playoff game in January 2008.

""You know, it's very hard when you lose, because games are important, and so many people put so much time and effort in,"" Romo told VF. ""It's nice to have someone to come home to and try and make you feel better.""

""That's how the story goes,"" Simpson offered. ""Can't help it. But we don't let it affect our relationship. If we did, we wouldn't be together, because it happened at the very beginning. Dating the Cowboys quarterback comes with hype, the fans, the bloggers, but I've never dated a guy that was more simple.

-5372899633,Brad Pitt Looking To Buy New Place In LA Arts District Amid Angelina Jolie Romance Rumors,"REX/Shutterstock

Since splitting with his wife Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt has found ‘comfort’ spending time in the LA arts district, known as Frogtown. So much so, that the actor is now looking for a new place to purchase in the hip neighborhood, HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY reports. Read here for all details!

Brad Pitt, 53, is no stranger to the art scene in Los Angeles. In fact, the father of six has been spending more and more time at his friend Thomas Houseago‘s studio. “Brad is looking to buy space here (Frogtown). He wants to convert one of the warehouses into a studio and art gallery. He’s got tons of friends in the arts community and wants to help new and upcoming artists have a voice, somewhere they can showcase their work,” an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. How cool!

As you may remember, Brad dived into an art project as a way of coping with his harsh divorce form Angelina Jolie, 41. “He also very much an artist in his own right,” the source says. “He spends quite a bit of time here. I think he feels a sense of comfort here because every one treats him like a regular person. He seems to like that.”

In addition to looking into some new digs, the superstar has been on the dating scene. “He has been dating a bit,” an insider revealed to People. “It’s not anything serious.” Phew! “He doesn’t have a girlfriend,” the source says. “He seems more comfortable double-dating…It’s more of a way to get out and be social.”

Good for him! Especially since it seems his ex has found a new man of her own. “It is challenging for Angelina to move on from Brad, but she is doing what she can to nurture a secret romance with a new guy,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. According to the insider, Angelina’s mystery man is a handsome British entrepreneur. Sounds hot! “They have held a few secret rendezvous at the Malibu estate where she has been staying occasionally since her split from Brad.”

HollywoodLifers, are YOU surprised Brad is so involved with the LA art community? Do YOU think he should buy a new place and turn it into a gallery or art studio?

-5367025314,Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson Are Feuding on 'The Voice',"When The Voice cameras are rolling, Jennifer Hudson and Miley Cyrus seem chummy. However, behind the scenes, tensions are flaring and Jennifer’s unexpected split from fiancé David Otunga may explain why.

Fellow coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton inadvertently sparked trouble between the two women, an insider explained, when they teased Miley, 24, about her on-again, off-again engagement to Liam Hemsworth. “Miley wasn’t in a good mood and is just over them teasing her about Liam,” an insider told_ Life & Style exclusively_. So she tried to shift the focus. “Miley said that they should be asking Jennifer about her long engagement.”

Unfortunately for Miley, Jennifer was standing right behind her when she made the “long engagement” comment. “The room immediately got tense,” the insider revealed. “Jennifer looked Miley right in the eye and told her to never mention her private life again, or even say David’s name.” At the time the source said that Jennifer just isn’t the type to joke around, but now it seems she was trying to hide her relationship issues from her co-judges.

J-Hud, 36, had been engaged to the former pro wrestler since 2008 until recently when it was revealed that a protective order was granted against the father of her eight-year-old son David Jr. “They have been in the process of ending their relationship for a number of months,” Jennifer’s rep said. “Jennifer requested and received a protective order against her ex-fiancé. Jennifer’s actions are solely taken in the best interest of their son.”",fake
-5376124345,Report: Obama Pleads With Jay-Z to Prevent Other Hip Hop Artists Meeting With Trump,"Former President Barack Obama has reportedly asked Jay-Z to encourage other hip hop artists not to meet with Donald Trump following the firestorm of publicity over Kanye West.

The claim is being made by pro-Trump activist Josh Cornett, who tweeted, “Sources are confirming that former President Barack Obama has called Jay-Z several times over the past month pleading with Jay-Z to discourage fellow Hip Hop artists from meeting with President Trump.”

🚨BREAKING: Sources are confirming that former President Barack Obama has called Jay-Z several times over the past month pleading with Jay-Z to discourage fellow Hip Hop artists from meeting with President Trump…..developing pic.twitter.com/0rApmQ4DDH — 🚨Josh Cornett🚨 (@therealcornett) 18 May 2018

The tweet has received over 7,600 retweets and over 10,000 likes since being posted.

Donald Trump Jr. also liked the tweet, leading some to speculate that he may know that the story is true.

While the story remains unconfirmed, it would make political sense for Democrats to deter pop icons from being seen to endorse President Trump in any way as the mid-terms draw nearer.

In the week after Kanye West tweeted his support for Candace Owens, a vocal African-American Trump supporter, Trump’s popularity amongst black males jumped from 11 per cent to 22 per cent.

It has also been pointed out that before Trump ran as a Republican, he was a popular figure amongst the hip hop community, being name dropped in the lyrics of numerous hit songs.

Democrats routinely rely on endorsements from celebrities, with both Jay-Z and Beyonce being prominent supporters of Hillary Clinton during the election.

Any shift away from superstars using their platforms to amplify leftist narratives would spell disaster for the Dems, who have already lost 9 per centsupport from millennial registered voters aged between18 to 34 since the 2016 election.

-5379009295,Jennifer Aniston warns Justin Theroux: stay away from Terry Richardson!,"The more time Justin Theroux spends in New York City without his fiancée Jennifer Aniston, the more likely he is to spend time with his BFF Terry Richardson. Considering the recent rash of Theroux interviews, I’ve been finding it a bit odd that Uncle Terry has not been quoted at all. After all, Terry and Justin DO spend a lot of time together. Jennifer used to hang out with Terry too – Terry took the first exclusive photos of Justin and Jennifer together, and subsequently did portraits of JustJen months later as well. But that was back in 2011. I haven’t heard much about Jennifer spending time with Terry recently, just Justin. So maybe this Star Mag story is true?

Terry Richardson does not have a friend in Jennifer Aniston. Richardson, 48, who is currently facing accusations of sexual assault by multiple models, has caused major tension between Jen and her fiancé of nearly two years, Justin Theroux. While preparations for the pair’s wedding are (finally) underway, Justin is adamant that his god pal Terry do the photography. But Jennifer has issued a strict “keep the creep away” policy for their big day. “Terry rubs Jen the wrong way,” dishes a close source. “She feels like she needs to take a shower after hanging out with him. She doesn’t like his jokes or the way he talks about women, and feels like he’s constantly checking out her boobs.”

[From Star Magazine]

“Terry rubs Jen the wrong way.” That’s what all of Uncle Terry’s victims said too. No, in truth, they mostly said that Terry rubs himself the wrong way and it’s because he gets off on humiliation and degradation. So, I’m not going to say anything about Aniston other than… I hope this is true. I hope she has a good enough perv-radar to steer clear of Terry. But what’s Justin’s excuse? Ew. I don’t even want to think about that too much.",fake

While Justin Bieber, 24, has reignited his romance with Hailey Baldwin in the most public of ways, his ex Selena Gomez isn’t looking for relationship payback.The 25-year-old doesn’t care that he rebounded back to the 21-year-old model, who he briefly dated in 2016. “Selena is not treating love as a game or a competition and whatever Justin is doing or getting into is not dictating her love life. She wants to spend this summer in her best health and everything else can and will fall into place.” a source close to the “Wolves” singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

What a difference a year makes. This time last summer Selena did have a loving boyfriend with The Weeknd, 28, but she sure didn’t have her health. She found out in late spring that she desperately needed a life-saving kidney transplant due to complications from lupus, and quickly too. Fortunately her best friend Francia Raisa, 29, turned out to be a perfect match and Sel didn’t have to agonize over being on a waiting list for the organ. She underwent the transplant and spent the summer recovering from it, all completely in secret without her fans knowing about the health crisis. It was only on Sept. 14, 2017 when a website broke the story that she confirmed the news with a heartwarming pic of the two ladies clasping hands on stretchers after the successful surgery.

Selena ending things with The Weeknd after 10 months of dating, shocking fans by going back to her ex Justin in Oct. of 2017. They managed to make it last for a few months, but her family was not supportive, fearing the Biebs would break Selena’s heart like he did so many times in the past. Sel allegedly spent most of January in an outpatient treatment facility for some self-help time to deal with anxiety and other issues. Shortly after that the couple appeared to end things for good. Selena’s been a single lady ever since, but if the right guy comes along she might get back in the dating game. “She is not looking but her heart is open if love comes knocking,” our insider adds.",fake

“The claims that have been made are a misinterpretation of an entirely innocent situation,” Schnabel said in a statement obtained by Us Weekly. “There is nothing more to this than I was simply saying goodnight to a family friend and we went our separate ways.”

Klum — who is mom of Leni, 13, Henry, 11, Johan, 10, and Lou, 7, with ex husband Seal — and the art dealer, 30, have been dating since 2014, following her split from her former bodyguard Martin Kirsten.

Now, the New Zealand pop star has tweeted a statement clarifying that that’s not the case.

“Taylor is a dear friend,” she wrote. “I love her very much. … Really sh–ty to wake up to headlines about whether or not you’ve jumped ship on someone you deeply respect and ride for. I want to say one more time that Taylor has been there for me in all my dark and light moments these past five years. All of them.”

Lorde did, however, take the opportunity to elaborate on the initial quote she gave in her interview, where she seemed to say that she doesn’t hang out much with the famous friends she’s made in recent years and isn’t “calling [her] idols” for advice.

For one, Lorde noted that while some had thought she was referencing Swift as an “idol,” she was really just referring to David Bowie and Patti Smith, who she’d mentioned earlier in the interview.

She also expounded on the flaws of describing Swift’s group of friends as a “squad.” “I’ve always found people’s perception of this ‘squad’ idea frustrating in the past,” she wrote. “It was never some exclusive club or secret society, but a wide circle of people, some of whom I know, and some who I’ve never met, like most wide groups of friends. Forgive me for the mild eyeroll I popped when it was brought up as if we’re all blood members of a secret cult.”

Of course, Lorde — whose second album, Melodrama, debuted at the top of Billboard’s albums chart last month — brushed the whole thing off. “I f—ed up an interview question,” she concluded. “Now go sip a beverage and head out on a walk.” See her complete note below.",fake

For the last few months, Kim and Sarah Jessica Parker have been feuding over the prospect of creating a third movie. Sarah Jessica Parker is vocal about wanting to make a sequel, whereas Kim has openly refused to take part, leading to some not-so-pretty exchanges over social media.

But, if the franchise is to continue without Kim, producers will either have to remove her from the plot entirely, or find a new actor to play Samantha Jones.

An Australian betting company has just released stats that found the common consensus is Kim will more likely be replaced than killed off.

Which prompts the next question, who would (or even could) replace Kim as the fabulously crass publicist?",fake

-5263498053,"Caitlyn Jenner considering ‘de-transitioning’ ‘in the next couple years,’ author claims","A Kardashian family biographer claims Caitlyn Jenner is experiencing regret over transitioning from male to female. Citing multiple sources close to the star, Ian Halperin told The Wrap that Jenner is considering transitioning back to male “in the next couple years.” However, the 66-year-old's rep denied the author's claims in an email to FOX411.

Halperin said while doing research for his book “Kardashian Dynasty: The Controversial Rise of America’s Royal Family,” several sources indicated Jenner is unhappy.

“One source confirmed to me Caitlyn has made whispers of ‘sex change regret,’ hinting she might go back to being Bruce Jenner,” Halperin told the entertainment website.

The biographer said Jenner is allegedly interested in transitioning back for relationship reasons.

“She’s still into women and wants to meet the right one,” Halperin stated.

Jenner's rep told FOX411 regarding Halperin's claims, ""it is not true."" The rep added Halperin ""is a moron.""

The idea that Jenner has had apprehensions over the life change is nothing new. Back when Jenner graced the cover of Vanity Fair, the former Olympian described a panic attack following the transition.

The Vanity Fair profile detailed: “During the first full day of recuperation… She was undergoing something that had never happened before in 65 years of life: a panic attack… The panic attack lasted about 15 seconds, but a single thought continued to course through her mind: ‘What did I just do? What did I just do to myself?’”

Halperin the transition has been “very hard” for the star.

“She’s thrilled she has raised awareness about how transgender people have long been discriminated against but I think there’s a chance she’ll de-transition in the next couple years,” the writer said. “I don’t think it would surprise anybody in her inner circle. It has been much harder than she anticipated. My heart goes out to her and I know her true friends will be there to support her on whatever path she chooses.”",fake

It’s a race against the clock for Tristan Thompson to propose to Khloé Kardashian! The denim designer reportedly doesn’t want to be an unwed mother, and according to a Radar source, she doesn’t even want to make the announcement until there’s a ring on her finger.

“Khloé is pushing her man for a ring harder than ever before now,” said the insider. “At this point, she is practically begging him to propose. She does not want to be just his girlfriend when this baby is born and she wants him to do it stat!” Khloé has not yet publicly admitted that she’s expecting, but since her alleged due date is in February, she doesn’t have long before the cat is out of the bag. Tristan better hurry up!

Khloé hasn’t been shy about wanting to marry Tristan, even as far back as April (which is when she is reported to have conceived the baby.” When asked if she would accept a proposal from Tristan in ES magazine, she enthusiastically said “Yes, I would.” She also gushed about him, saying she had “never been in this kind of love before.” Furthermore, she hinted about having kids, which in hindsight should have tipped us off that she was about to get pregnant (or was already.)

“I would love to have a family. We’ve talked about it,” she admitted. “He is a father, and I know for a fact that he would be an impeccable father.” Tristan’s ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig gave birth to his child in December 2016, after he and Khloé started dating. So, you can see why she wants to lock him down officially before the baby comes. No one wants to be just another random baby mama! It sounds like they’re both on the same page and want to spend their future together, so Tristan should just bite the bullet already and pop the question!",fake

Brad Pitt, with ex-wife Angelina Jolie



Los Angeles: Actress-filmmaker Angelina Jolie has reportedly made a Google alert on actor and estranged husband Brad Pitt's name to keep tabs on him.

""Angelina wants to know exactly what Brad is up to at all times. To say she isn't able to move on would be an understatement,"" a source told hollywoodlife.com.

""She likes to always be in control and she knows that once the divorce is finalised she will have no hold over him any more. It's pretty sad really, seeing as she was the one who wanted the divorce in the first place.

Jolie decided to end the marriage in September. Since then, the two have been in divorce and custody battle.

Although the ""Maleficent"" actress is the one who wanted to split, she is ""terrrified Brad will move on and find love with someone new"".

Smith and Robbie sizzle on screen together in the currently running dramatic comedy. But according to Gossip Cop.com, Pinkett Smith insists all the recent and ongoing talk about her being jealous of her husband's relationship with the budding young star is untrue.



Pinkett Smith's revelations come after some media outlets previously reported, ""She's seen them on the red carpet together -- they're all over each other. She's known Will for 20 years, so it's pretty obvious when he's got the hots for someone. And she doesn't trust Margot one bit.""



Smith and Robbie are also slated to work together on the upcoming flick ""Suicide Squad,"" and there have been previous reports that Pinkett Smith is ""stewing"" over the prospect of it all.

""Jada's dreading it,"" a source said. ""Will likes Margot too much, and the feeling seems mutual.""



As far back as 2013, Star Magazine ran a cover story alleging that Smith and Robbie had been ""caught cheating"" but that turned out to be much ado about nothing after it was found the most incriminating evidence was simply an instance of the two goofing off in some photos of them together at a party.



Through all the drama, a rep for Pinkett Smith now tells Gossip Cop the former ""Set It Off"" and ""Gotham"" star is convinced there's nothing factual in the rumors. Smith and Pinkett have been married since 1997 and have two teenage children together, both of whom have started to carve out their own place in Hollywood.



Starring in such films as ""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" Ali,"" ""Six Degrees of Separation"" and ""Bad Boys,"" the 46-year-old Smith has been nominated for four Golden Globe and two Academy Awards. He has also won four Grammys for his musical contributions.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Express.co.uk, Tracey Cox, a body language and relationships expert and TV presenter, claimed the Meghan and Harry are still getting to know each other two months after marriage. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were married on May 19 in a romantic ceremony at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle – less than two years after it is rumoured the pair met in the summer of 2016. Ms Cox told Express.co.uk: “They got married right in the middle of the honeymoon period when your brain is just flooded by love and sexual hormones and your judgement is completely skew. ""And now, anyone looking at them can tell they are absolutely smack bang in the middle, they are infatuated, they are at the lust stage, they are that wonderful stage everyone wants to stay at.""

When asked if the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's relationship differs from Prince William and Kate's, the expert suggested they could not be more contrasting. Ms Cox said: “Meghan and Harry they are still getting to know each other. “They are in the early, early, early stages.” “William and Kate have known each other since they were at university.”

LOVE BIRDS.....Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are still getting to know each other

She added: “You are looking at old love versus new love.” According to Ms Cox, the reason why Meghan and Harry's are still in their honeymoon stage is because of the secrecy they had to keep while dating. She said: “It is lasting so long for them because they haven’t seen each other that much. ""They hardly saw each other before and it was all in secret.""

Okay, that is definitely WAY less intense than what Media Take Out was reporting earlier, saying that Fergie’s bandmate Taboo Nawasha, 41, dissed the 41-year-old singer with a scathing tweet on May 24 that said she wasn’t one of the “classic” BEP members, and implied she was totally out of the band. He then unfollowed the 41-year-old singer on Twitter today, the same day it was announced she had left Interscope Records to start her own record label under BMG and will be working with them on her upcoming solo album, Double Duchess. Click here to see pics of Fergie’s “M.I.L.F. $” music video.

“Fergie has been focusing on her solo career a lot, and she wants to head in a different direction music-wise, so it was time to move on,” the insider continued. “Plus, she doesn’t want to be part of a band anymore, there are a lot of egos at play here, let’s just leave it at that. It was actually Fergie’s decision to leave, and the guys weren’t too happy about it initially, but they’re cool now and just looking forward to the future.”

There was a solid decade where there was five or six cars minimum, and easily up to 15 or 20 on the weekends, outside of my house at all times. And looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I could cry talking about it.

Gossip Cop revealed that Garner never uttered the actual words during her CBS interview but somehow made the front cover of the OK! Furthermore, the magazine did not provide any grounds on which they added the quotes from the actress.

On the professional front, Ben Affleck recently signed onto the film adaptation of the critically acclaimed book The Last Thing He Wanted. The upcoming political thriller, which provides the backdrop of the Iran-Contra scandal, the Argo movie actor-director will share screen space with Anne Hathaway.

In addition to this, many are even wondering if the Academy award-winning actor will reprise his role of Batman in the upcoming Joker standalone movie featuring Jared Leto.

Meanwhile, Jennifer Garner's next project is a Spanish-American animated adventure film, Wonder Park. In the film, Garner will give voice to the protagonist's mother. The film is currently in development under Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Movies. Wonder Park is scheduled to be released on March 15, 2019, by Paramount Pictures.",fake
-5144862894,Trump made one of the biggest royal faux pas when visiting the Queen — and people are outraged,"US President Donald Trump met the Queen last Friday.

During the visit, Trump appeared to breach royal protocol by walking ahead of the Queen and awkwardly stopping in front of her.

The president was warned against making this particular faux pas last week by former royal butler Grant Harrold.

People on social media were outraged by Trump's lack of awareness.



You can't say he wasn't warned.

Last week, former royal butler Grant Harrold spoke to ITV News about all the ways Trump could offend the Queen on his controversial visit to the UK.

One piece of advice was to always let the Queen take the lead when walking around — but it would seem the tip fell on deaf ears.

In a truly cringe-worthy viral clip, President Trump is seen breaking etiquette by walking in front of the Queen and then blocking her off when he stops, forcing Her Majesty to manoeuvre around him.

This breach of royal protocol led to outrage on Twitter as people called out the president for his lack of awareness.

Trump was visiting Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle (where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were married) and took afternoon tea with the royal after they inspected the Coldstream Guards.

In an interview for The Daily Mail that took place on Air Force One, Trump raved about his meeting with the Queen: ""The Queen is fantastic!

""She's a fantastic woman; so much energy and smart and sharp. She was amazing! Such a wonderful lady and so beautiful! It was such an honour to finally meet her. To have a Queen like that is great.""

Although Trump was apparently happy to meet with the matriarch, many in the UK were not.

100,000 protestors flooded London's Trafalgar Square to object to the president's visit.

According to CBS, it was the largest weekday protest the city has seen in 15 years.",fake

The Duke of Gloucester, one of Queen Elizabeth II's cousins, and his wife, the Duchess of Gloucester, were the last to reside in Apartment 1. They have called the apartment home since 1972. The Sun had previously reported that the couple offered to vacate the property to make way for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, though this plan did not come to fruition in light of their move to Windsor.

Moving vans were spotted outside of Kensington Palace and are reportedly going to relocate the Duke and Duchess to the Old Stables, a smaller residence on Kensington Palace grounds. The Old Stables recently received a $493,000 renovation in preparation for the move.

Apartment 1 is a large complex of rooms in the main palace building, much like like William and Kate's home at 1A. The two used to be one enormous set of rooms until they were divided in the 1950s.

The complex has 21 rooms, slightly topping the size of William and Kate's, but few details are available other than its overall size.

Wearing a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos, she promptly took them off after posing for photos and walked the rest of the red carpet barefoot.

It’s a great moment in and of itself. However, it gets even better when you remember Cannes has a heels-only rule for red carpet screenings.

It’s no joke — women were turned away from a screening of Carol in 2015 because their shoes’ heels weren’t tall enough.

But when Stewart decided it was time for the shows to come off, that’s exactly what she did.

‘Things need to change’

Stewart has talked about Cannes’ antiquated rules before.

She told Vanity Fair in 2016: ‘Things have to change immediately.

‘It has become really obvious that if [a man and I] were walking the red carpet together and someone stopped me and said, “Excuse me, young lady, you’re not wearing heels. You cannot come in.” Then [I’m going to say], “Neither is my friend. Does he have to wear heels?” It can work both ways.’

But these days, he isn’t letting his ex’s antics get him down — and it may be due to the fact that he’s dating again!

As Life & Style previously reported, Angelina was making it hard for Brad to see his six children — Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9 — over the holidays. “Angie is using the kids as pawns against him,” an insider explains. “Brad knows he can’t count on scheduled days with the kids because Angie has changed the plans abruptly at the last minute multiple times.”

Though the old Brad may have responded in a fit of rage, he calmly thanked her for keeping him informed. “There are two choices for Brad,” the insider notes. “Fight back and get angry every time she pulls a stunt, which would only impacts the kids, or handle it like a mature adult. If that means he won’t see the kids as much or at the holidays, he has made peace with it.”

This attitude adjustment could be a result of the 53-year-old’s new social life. According to In Touch, Brad has become smitten with a 21-year-old British actress named Ella Purnell — who, interestingly enough, played a young Angelina in 2014’s Maleficent. He even cast her in his upcoming Starz series, Sweetbitter.

“Brad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,” a source explained. “Ella is incredibly flattered by all the attention she’s getting from Brad. She’s told friends he’s always been her No. 1 celebrity crush.”

Australian magazine New Idea is also reporting that Brad has become involved with Monaco princess, Charlotte Casiraghi, 31. “No one could believe it when we saw them together,” an alleged onlooker told the outlet. “There have been rumors circulating for weeks that Brad has moved on with a new woman, but no one was ready to see him hand-in-hand with royalty from Monaco.”

Despite reports of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes calling it quits on a relationship that some have dated as far back as five years ago, Katie Holmes’ publicist and other sources have confirmed that the stories are not at all true.

“The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, a rep for the actress said.

According to Page Six, the false report broke around the time that Foxx was in Atlantic City for the opening of the new Ocean Resort Casino and was filming with Mark Wahlberg the night before for his “Wahlburgers” television show.

“Jamie was telling friends he’s expecting his girlfriend Katie Holmes to join him in Atlantic City,” the source tells the publication, adding that, “Katie’s daughter, Suri, wouldn’t be coming down — because she was in summer camp.”

This contradicted Radar Online's report Wednesday about Katie calling Jamie over the phone because she “couldn’t get over her trust issues.” Radar Online would add that there was “no drama . . . just sadness when Katie called up Jamie to tell him she couldn’t do this anymore.”

Sources also say that while Foxx was at the new casino’s opening, he was at the head of a conga line of nearly 1,000 people and was directing the DJ to alternate between Prince and Michael Jackson songs. According to them, Jamie reportedly footed a bill for 100 bottles of Dom Perignon champagne. On his usual antics, the comedian, actor, and singer even got down on one knee and proposed to a 93-year old patron in the building.

“This is what it’s all about, loving everybody,” Foxx said to the sea of people.

-5011578652,Watch Jenna Dewan Sizzle In Dance Off With J.Lo In 'World Of Dance' Trailer,"We know all too well the struggle of squeezing into lycra on a hot summer’s day. And don’t get us started on what we look like when we attempt to wriggle into a wetsuit (the image of Free Willy comes to mind...).

However, one person who appears to have no problem with donning clothing of the skin-tight variety is Hollywood star Jenna Dewan, and we are in awe.

Last night, the newly single dancer/actress posted a video of herself dancing with her World Of Dance judges and let’s just say, she’s looking h-o-t.

In the clip, the mother-of-one - who recently announced her split from husband of eight years Channing Tatum - can be seen spinning, throwing her leg up in the air, and slapping her derrière.

For the dance-off, the star's blunt cropped hair-do has been styled into wet-look curls, which is perfectly complemented by her silver-hued smokey eyeshadow and pillar-box red lip.

In the clip, she also dances with Dancing With The Stars alum, Derek Hough, who spins the Step Up star upside down. ‘YA’LL we had so much fun making this for you!!!’ Dewan captioned the video.

The star’s post comes days after singer Nick Jonas was caught innocently flirting with the 37-year-old on Instagram following the Billboard Music Awards.

In a post of her outfit from the night, Dewan captioned the snap 'Billboard Awards- 'twas such a fun night!!! Thank you for having me! #bbmas', prompting the crooner to comment 'Twas. 'Twasn't it.'

Even Jenna’s stylist, Brad Goreski, was quick to pick up on the not-so-subtle flirtation tactic. ‘Omg nick Jonas commented!!!!’ he gushed.

In another promo for the NBC show posted by Jennifer Lopez, the Bronx-born singer busts a move in an oversized ‘JLo’ emblazoned sports jersey, much to the delight of her co-stars Dewan, Hough and singer Ne-Yo.

Paris Jackson got cozy with Aussie model Tyler Green during the Melbourne Cup horse race in November, and her famous family isn’t exactly moonwalking with delight. They fear the pairing could spell trouble for the 19-year-old model, who’s struggled with sobriety in the past.

“Paris’ family worries she’ll start partying again because of Tyler,” an insider exclusively tells Life & Style. Tyler, 25, has bragged about his wild ways on Instagram, posting about months of “far too much drinking” and praising “bottomless red wine and pure debauchery.”

(Photo Credit: Splash)

Despite those red flags, Paris — who’s admitted to attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and who says she was suicidal after the death of dad Michael Jackson — is smitten. “Paris is trying to walk the straight and narrow, but she’s also looking for fun,” notes the insider. “She makes her own decisions, but her family wants her to make the right ones.”

Paris’ family’s concerns about her latest romance come months after she finally called it quits with on-and-off boyfriend Michael Snoddy. Back in February, a source told Us Weekly that the duo broke up after less than a year of dating. Though the insider said that Paris could end up reconciling with Michael in the future, they also said that the aspiring actress was more focused on her career than her love life.

“It appears that Paris and Michael have parted ways for now, but their future is uncertain,” the source said, adding that Paris was very excited about her guest role on Fox’s TV drama Star. “She is doing well, enjoying being on set with Lee Daniels and focusing her energy on the opportunities ahead.”

While she has yet to make her relationship with Tyler Instagram official, Paris did post a telling quote about love on Oct. 23: “People say love ism blind because they do not know what love is. I say unto you, only love has eyes; other than love, everything is blind.”

-4992887613,Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Are Reportedly Building a $50K Pool,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are putting in a pool, according to TMZ, which says it obtained copies of building permits for the in-progress pool at the couple's Hidden Hills estate. Aerial photos published by TMZ indicate the pool—reportedly clocking in at 20-by-60 feet—is already well in development, although it's unclear when it will be complete. TMZ also reported that the Wests spent another $12,000 on building a new guard shack. Whether this is specifically to deter would-be skinny-dippers, or if it's just another add-on to their already tight security team, is unclear.

There's no word on who designed the pool, but it would not be surprising if it turned out to be Kanye West himself. In May, the multihyphenate added another hyphen when he announced he was starting a new architecture firm called Yeezy Home. ""We’re looking for architects and industrial designers who want to make the world better,"" he wrote on Twitter. As Architectural Digest reported, this wasn't just a ploy to expand his résumé—he worked with Axel Vervoordt on the Hidden Hills home, sharing photos of its Zen Brutalist aesthetic on Twitter.

It would also not be surprising if West got pretty hands-on in the construction of his new pool. In a previous interview with Architectural Digest, Kim Kardashian West revealed that her husband is quite the builder. ""My husband makes all of his own furniture in his office,"" she said. ""My office is all Vincent Van Duysen, but Kanye is so good at it, he loves to draw out pieces. Axel made a couch in our house called the 'Kanye couch' because Kanye designed it with him.""",fake

Of course, it’s common practice for the tabloids to romantically link musicians of the opposite sex who collaborate together, so Gossip Cop was hesitant to believe this latest alleged fling. Our doubts were confirmed after checking in with a rep for Carey, who exclusively tells us the outlet’s report is entirely “false.” We’re assured the singer wasn’t flirting with her colleague, nor did the two go home together.

Naturally, Life & Style isn’t the best source when it comes to finding accurate news about the singer. Gossip Cop previously busted the tabloid for making up a story about Carey hiring a speech therapist to teach her to speak with a British accent. GC also corrected the magazine after it falsely claimed Carey gives money to boyfriend Bryan Tanaka so he can buy her gifts. The publication’s latest article suggesting Carey and Montana are more than just collaborators is equally bogus.

Her brunette tresses were up in a long ponytail and she carried a water bottle, coffee cup and her phone in one hand.

Cleveland Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson has avoided a suspension for Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals following his actions near the end of Game 1 on Thursday night.

The league announced on Friday, via Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel, Thompson has been fined $25,000, while his flagrant-2 foul has been downgraded to a flagrant-1.

Thompson was ejected with 2.6 seconds remaining in overtime of Golden State's 124-114 victory after the referee deemed he threw an elbow at Warriors guard Shaun Livingston. He was assessed a flagrant-2 on the play.

Instead of leaving the court and going to the locker room, however, Thompson was at the center of a scrum during which he shoved the basketball in the face of Warriors forward Draymond Green.

When asked what led tempers to flare, Thompson said Warriors guard Shaun Livingston took an unnecessary shot (NSFW language):

That confrontation caught the eye of Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley:

Thompson had a quiet game to open the series. The 6'9"", 238-pound big man posted just two points on 1-of-4 shooting while grabbing five rebounds. He recorded a plus/minus of minus-nine in 20 minutes.

Although he did not make an impact in Game 1, Thompson may be a key to victory for Cleveland. When the Cavs won their first-ever championship in 2016, Thompson was a force in the paint, averaging 10.3 points and 10.1 rebounds per game in the Finals.",fake

In court documents obtained by People, a judge reportedly tells Angelina that limiting the time Brad gets to spend with Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne is 'harmful' to the kids.

Furthermore, she has apparently been told to help 'repair' the relationship and speak with the children and their doctors to assure them, ""they are safe with their father.”

""It is critical that each of [the six] children have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother,” the documents say, according to the website.

The thugs (with the calling card black hand) migrated from Italy to America, and kidnapped people to extort money from their families.

They can’t get through one conversation without it turning into a huge argument.”

Speculation as to where Khloe would live long-term sparked when the Cleveland Cavaliers player was caught on camera allegedly cheating on his then-pregnant girlfriend. The insider is saying that Tristan’s actions still haven’t fully been forgiven. “She can’t stop being angry at Tristan,” the source said. “Not living together is a clear sign that things aren’t going well.”

Tristan and the rest of the Cavs played in the NBA Finals last week, in which they lost to the Golden State Warriors after a 0 to 4 game run. Now that the basketball star has some time off, it’s not completely surprising that he and his girlfriend are ready to head back to the west coast.

However, the move might only be for a short amount of time since it was previously reported that the Revenge Body host was making Cleveland a permanent home. “She’s creating a life for her family in Cleveland,” a source told PEOPLE magazine in early May. “Khloe is in a really good place” and “feels whole” with her first child, the insider added.

Despite all the controversy West has endured over the past few years, and the concerts (such as the one in San Jose in 2016) where he delivered amazingly disappointing and perplexing performances, West remains a huge commercial force in music

He just released his eighth studio album, “Ye,” which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

On one of the album’s songs, “I Thought About Killing You,” West raps that he thinks about killing himself. He opens up on the topic a bit more in the New York Times interview, when asked about the song.

“Oh yeah, I’ve thought about killing myself all the time. It’s always a option and [expletive],” he says in the interview. “Like Louis C.K. said: ‘I flip through the manual. I weigh all the options.’

“I’m just having this epiphany now, ’cause I didn’t do it, but I did think it all the way through. But if I didn’t think it all the way through, then it’s actually maybe more of a chance of it happening.”",fake

The Come & Get It hitmaker’s second solo album was released in 2015 and the star admits she’s found it harder than ever to complete the follow-up, reports aceshowbiz.com.

“This has been building for maybe two years,” she said during a chat on Apple Music’s Beats 1.

“I was really happy with Revival, but at the same time, I was terrified of doing another record because, for me, it could be like it was a step down or I needed to beat that record, and I think every artist kind of struggles with that. So I waited. I wanted it to be great, and had I not waited a good year or two, I wouldn’t have had the best songs I’ve ever had,” said Gomez.

The singer is currently in the process of “finishing up” the third album and is yet to decide its release date.

She gave fans a taste of her new music by dropping Back to you on May 10, and quickly cleared up speculation suggesting the song is about her on-off romance with former boyfriend Justin Bieber.

Despite the intense emotional toll that this might take on someone, Selena Gomez has managed to navigate a path with grace and has it figured out.

At a mere 25-years-old, the actress-slash-singer is pretty much a confident sage when it comes to body positivity—especially since her life-saving kidney transplant, which she got earlier this year to help with her autoimmune disease called lupus.

""When I look at my body now, I just see life,"" Gomez tells Billboard in a recent interview (oh yeah, she just won their 'Woman of the Year' award, NBD). ""There are a million things I could do—lasers and creams and all that stuff—but I'm okay with it. I don't have perfect abs, but I feel like I'm wonderfully made.""

""I don't have perfect abs, but I feel like I'm wonderfully made.""

That's not to say this self-confidence came easily—especially as she's facing a newly minted surgery scar (which she admits was ""hard in the beginning""). ""I remember looking at myself in the mirror completely naked and thinking about all the things that I used to bitch about and just asking, 'Why?'"" she says.

Now, after all that she's been through (which is a lot), Gomez is feeling all of the positive vibes. ""I just keep thinking about how much my body is my own,"" she says. ""[After the surgery] I had this sense of gratitude for myself. I don’t think I’ve ever just stopped and been like, 'I’m actually grateful for who I am.' I do. I didn't, but I do now.""

A seemingly very well-connected source at Page Six is passing on info that the couple is still in regular communication.

Apparently a “jet-setting source” told Page Six that Holmes and Foxx were FaceTiming on the plane as Holmes and Suri Cruise departed for Paris: “She said she loves him and asked if he wanted ‘cookies from Paris.’ He was in Miami.” Suri’s nanny was reportedly also on the plane.

Foxx has, indeed, been in Miami; he was seen at mega-club E11EVEN on Sunday. The fact that we know this, and that we know Holmes is in Paris with Suri for fashion shows, is kind of monumental. This is a pairing that has managed to stay below the surface since they got together in 2013; though there is a timeline of their relationship, there are big gaps here where no one knows anything.

As Vanity Fair pointed out last year, Holmes and Foxx went to F.B.I.-level lengths to avoid tabloid attention. They reportedly hid out in a luxury resort to celebrate at least Holmes’s 38th birthday, and Holmes “put on a wig and hat” to meet Foxx.

Now, it seems that the high-security walls of this relationship keep tumbling down. People are overhearing FaceTime conversations and spotting Foxx and Holmes out during their nighttime adventures. Perhaps we had fair warning: last year, Us Weekly reported that Holmes was tired of “playing the hiding game.” And what better way to combat breakup rumors than to stop hiding altogether?",fake

“Knew enough since Clinton was President and MC Hammer was selling millions of records. That’s a lot of years to not confront a friend,” Apatow wrote on Twitter on Thursday night.

In an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Tarantino admitted that he knew of Weinstein’s alleged mistreatment of women years ago but did not do enough to stop it.

In the interview, the director, who worked with Weinstein on basically all his major film projects, said that he’d known about Weinstein’s action as far back as the ’90s but didn’t do anything to stop it, something he admits to regretting.

“I knew enough to do more than I did,” Tarantino told the paper. “There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip. It wasn’t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things.”

Tarantino owned up to hearing directly from his ex-girlfriend Mira Sirvino and another unnamed actres about their experiences with Weinstein. He also was aware that Rose McGowan, who last week tweeted that Weinstein had raped her, had allegedly reached a legal settlement with him. Despite this, he did not realize that the incidents were part of a larger pattern.

“What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he said. “Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”

Instead, Tarantino continued to work with Weinstein in the years since, including on Oscar-nominated films “Inglorious Basterds” and “Django Unchained.”

Her embroidered veil and diamond-and-platinum tiara (a loaner from grandma-in-law Queen Elizabeth II) will also be on public display.

The exhibition gets underway on Oct. 28 and will run through Jan. 6, 2019. The wedding regalia will then move to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, Scotland, from June 14-Oct. 6, 2019.

The magazine quotes a so-called source close to Celine as saying, ""David and Celine have been close for 25 years; He's like family."" But it goes on claiming, ""Celine may be too deep in the friend zone to have a shot with the music mogul,"" noting that David recently divorced Yolanda Hadid and is currently with Christie Brinkley.



""He's been in constant contact with Celine since Rene passed away, but he sees her as a friend, not a lover,"" the alleged source reveals to the news outlet. ""When we bring it up, she blushes and says, 'I love David, but he only dates supermodels,' "" the insider adds.



While both Celine and David have yet to give any comment regarding the report, a friend of the ""My Heart Will Go On"" hitmaker has shot it down, telling Gossip Cop that the above claim is ""ridiculous."" The fact is Celine doesn't have a crush on David and is not ""too deep in the friend zone to have shot"" with the 67-year-old music mogul.

-4606959328,Elon Musk’s ‘Pedo’ Tweet Inquiry Answered: Thai Rescue Diver’s Lawyer Preps Lawsuit,"A lawyer representing the diver who Elon Musk recently accused of being a pedophile said on Wednesday that he sent the Tesla chief a letter that says that he’s preparing to file a libel lawsuit.

The development is the latest twist in the entrepreneur’s turbulent summer on Twitter and comes one day after Musk questioned why the diver hadn’t sued him if his claims were untrue.

“You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services,” asked Musk in reply to @Yoda on Twitter.

Attorney L. Lin Wood, who is representing diver Vernon Unsworth, replied to the thread on Wednesday, saying that Musk “should check his mail before tweeting.”

https://twitter.com/LLinWood/status/1034761900100407296

Musk originally called Unsworth — a diver that criticized Musk’s attempts to help the Thai soccer team trapped in a cave as a “PR stunt” — a “pedo guy” in July. Musk later apologized for his comment, saying it was “spoken in anger.”

“You published three different tweets to your twenty-two million followers that Mr. Unsworth engages in the sexual exploitation of Thai children, and you did so at a time when he was working to save the lives of twelve Thai children,” Wood said in his letter, dated August 6, to Musk. “You did so without any basis.”

Wood added that he’s prepping a civil libel complaint against Musk.

A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.

Even without a potential civil suit on his hands, it’s already been a controversial month for 47-year-old entrepreneur. Musk is under the regulatory microscope after bringing Wall Street to a halt earlier this summer, tweeting he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private. Musk announced last Friday, after talking to shareholders, to keep Tesla a publicly traded company. Tesla shares have dropped about 20 percent to $305 a share since Musk tweeted about going private.",fake

She’s the one who got away! It’s hard to believe that it’s only been one year since Kylie Jenner and Tyga split — especially because so much has changed for Kylie since then. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is now a mom to an adorable little girl named Stormi Webster — whom she shares with her new boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — and even though she’s already moved on and had a whole baby with another man, sources exclusively revealed to In Touch that Tyga isn’t really over Kylie.

“Even though they’re not together, Tyga misses Kylie. For real,” the insider told In Touch. “He misses her sexiness. Her body. The lavish life, connections, money and exposure she gave him. He misses all of that and kicks himself every day for letting their relationship die.”

Kylie and Tyga dated for about three years — which is an eternity in celeb time — but they broke up in 2017 shortly after Valentine’s Day. Fans were shocked to learn that Kylie had moved on so quickly from Tyga when she started dating Travis in April 2017 — and it was even more shocking that she got pregnant less than two months into their relationship. Sources revealed that Kylie’s pregnancy was especially hard for Tyga to accept, because he eventually hoped to start a family with the lip kit mogul — and even though Kylie seems to be happy and in love with Travis and their little family, Tyga is still holding on to hope that there might still be a chance for him to get back togegther with her.

“What’s worse: she’s got a baby with Travis. That gnaws at him,” the insider continued. “He wanted to be the one who gave Kylie a baby. He wanted that so much but she was opposed. Tyga’s pissed about that. But even still, he forgives her because he loves her. And he knows he could still have a baby with her later down the line if they were ever to rekindle the passion they once had.”",fake

Cara Delevingne, 25, and Paris Jackson, 20, have been stirring up romance rumors left and right and their latest outing is only fueling the fire. The pair were spotted hanging out together in New York City just a few hours after they each attended the Longchamp Fifth Avenue store opening on May 3. Paris wore a printed white t-shirt, jeans, and black booties, while the Paper Towns star rocked a strikingly similar ensemble: a white tank top, denim Bermuda shorts and black knee-high boots.

While the two women have yet to confirm whether or not they’re dating, fans are dying to know their relationship status. Fortunately, we’ve heard that there’s a unique bond between them. “Cara and Paris are crazy about each other,” a source close to the British model tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. “They have amazing chemistry and a super strong attraction. Whenever they’re together they have an awesome time.”

However, their time together is often limited due to scheduling conflicts – as per most celebrity friendships and relationships. “Cara and Paris don’t get to see each other as much as they would like to right now, as Cara’s work schedule is insane, but when they do they really make the most of their time together,” our insider adds. “Cara is totally smitten with Paris, she loves how smart and funny she is, and finds her sexy as hell.”

This isn’t the first time this week that the two models had fans questioning if they were an item. Paris shared a pic of her rumored girlfriend’s profile on Instagram. The image showed Cara blowing smoke from a cigarette out of her mouth and standing outside against a wall.

It could have been a reference to her sexual assault trial as a single dollar bill can be seen in the tub which is all Taylor wanted from winning the case.

It could also be a nod to that time when Taylor made the following statement about the media:

""Every single article had these descriptions of my personality that were very different from the actual personality and my first reaction was like, that's a bummer, this isn't fun for me. But then my second reaction ended up being like, hey, that's actually a really interesting character they're writing about.

-4575106109,"No, In Touch, Megyn Kelly is Not Replacing Matt Lauer on Today","Gossip Cop today debunked a tabloid cover story claiming that Megyn Kelly is replacing Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today show.

In Touch’s latest cover features a headline screaming “Shakeup At The ‘Today Show’: Matt Replaced By Megyn,” along with a dubious story alleging betrayal and backstabbing between the two television heavy-hitters.

Yet the piece “appears to be wholly manufactured by the publication,” according to Mediaite‘s sister site Gossip Cop.

What’s more, the tabloid offers up some fairly outrageous evidence to support its story, claiming Kelly showed up Lauer by nabbing a joint interview with President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. It’s fairly safe to assume Trump will not be joining Putin on a love seat for for a tell-all with Megyn Kelly anytime soon, as much as we would like to will that into existence.

Lauer, Gossip Cop reports, will continue to be the face of Today and a key fixture at NBC News despite the arrival of Kelly, which is currently slated for June.

From the report:

The notion that Lauer has been “replaced,” says an extremely well-placed NBC News insider, is “totally false.” And as for the contention that there will be a joint Putin and Trump interview, and that it will be conducted by Kelly, our impeccable source calls it “laughable.”

In Touch has published a number of demonstrably false stories touting a feud between Lauer and Kelly, including another cover story from February alleging Lauer was going to be “dumped” at the Today show in favor of the former Fox News star.

Last September, when she was still at Fox, Kelly––who said she’s friends with Lauer and respects him a lot––defended him after he got criticism in the liberal media for not being tough enough on Donald Trump during that NBC News presidential forum.

It reads: “As Lady Gaga‘s legal team will present to the court, she has provided all of the relevant information in her possession and is at most an ancillary witness in this process. Dr. Luke’s team is attempting to manipulate the truth and draw press attention to their case by exaggerating Lady Gaga‘s role and falsely accusing her of dodging reasonable requests.”

Dr. Luke is continuing his defamation lawsuit against Kesha. The music producer has now subpoenaed Lady Gaga for a deposition for her involvement in the case.

“Dr. Luke’s counsel served a subpoena on Lady Gaga because she has relevant information regarding, among other things, false statements about Dr. Luke made to her by Kesha,” said Dr. Luke’s lawyer in a statement on Saturday. “This motion has become necessary because Dr. Luke’s counsel has not been able to obtain, despite repeated request, a deposition date from Lady Gaga.”

Popular on Variety

According to a TMZ report, Lady Gaga did submit a written statement, but redacted too much of the content to prove useful. She could now be required to attend a 3-hour, sit-down interview instead.

Lady Gaga has publicly supported Kesha throughout her sexual assault case against Dr. Luke — including tweeting #FreeKesha — and is said to have exchanged text messages with the pop star.

“In connection with Dr. Luke’s defamation claims against Kesha, various third parties are being deposed by both sides, including celebrities,” his lawyer’s statement also confirmed.

It’s worth noting the usage of “celebrities” — plural — meaning other A-listers may find themselves on the stand.

Instead of spending time on his love life, Pitt has apparently been putting all of his energy into parenting the six children he shares with Jolie, as well as his career, which includes a starring role in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. “He is focused on two of the most important things he should be focused on, and those are his children and his work,” the source said, adding that Pitt is “in a great place personally and professionally…. Being a father is his number one job, and he knows that. He will always be there for those children…. He’s spending more time out and about socializing with his close friends, but he also is still a homebody and appreciates hanging around his place.”

Pitt confirmed the latter in his latest revealing interview, with GQ, in which he talked about dealing with his loneliness. “You have to wrap your stuff up at night and bring order back to your chaos for the next day,” he said. “I find it a great opportunity for the introspection. Now you have to be real careful not to go too far that way and get cut off in that way. I’m really good at cutting myself off, and it’s been a problem. I need to be more accessible, especially to the ones I love.” Now, it seems like he’s taking the time to do that.",fake

2000: The Singing Debate

In an interview with Peter Travers, Clooney finally addressed something fans had been wondering for quite some time: Did he actually sing in O Brother, Where Art Thou? Since his aunt, the famed Rosemary Clooney, had such a stellar singing career, the producers assumed he, too, would have a solid set of pipes.



""Then we got into the recording studio and I sang 'Man of Constant Sorrow' with all the music playing, and I finished and looked up and there's that glass booth with all of them in it and no one would look me in the eye,"" he told Travers.

According to Wednesday's initial reports from Life & Style, the 25-year-old ""Bad Liar"" singer and the 46-year-old ex-husband of Jennifer Aniston have recently ""become closer than ever.""

""They've known each other for years through their manager,"" an insider explained to the publication, adding that their shared experience of both going through headline-breaking splits has pushed the pair closer. ""Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups,"" the sourced continued.



It's all simply speculation—no confirmation has come from Gomez, Theroux or either of their reps—though Life & Style's source adds fuel to the gossip by suggesting that Jennifer Aniston, ""is not happy"" about the rumored love connection between her Theroux and Gomez, her former husband of two years and friend, respectively.

There's certainly truth that Gomez and Theroux have been spending some time together. In early May, the two were spotted together in New York City, on a group outing with a whole crew of A-list pals, including Paul Rudd and his wife Julie Yaeger, Rooney Mara, and photographer friend to both Gomez and Theroux, Petra Collins.

BACKGRID

Like Gomez, Collins has also been linked to The Leftovers star, with romance rumors following shortly after Theroux and Aniston's public breakup back in February. But more recent reporting suggests that the pair are strictly platonic.

Due to the gaping 21-year age difference between Gomez and Theroux, it's likely that The Leftovers star and the ""Fetish"" singer are no more than friends—but in the small world of Hollywood, crazier things have happened.",fake

A source close to the Kardashian brood EXCLUSIVELY told us how Kanye tried to make Travis understand the importance of family, especially with Kylie expecting. “Kanye had a serious man to man talk with Travis about becoming a father at the Christmas party this week,” our source said. “It was an emotional conversation as Kanye explained to Travis how wonderful it is becoming a father for the first time, how his whole life is about to change for the better. It was a beautiful, sweet moment between the two guys, but there was also an important point Kanye wanted to make to the younger rapper.”

So, what were the wise words of advice and warning Kanye imparted to his younger protege? Man up. “Kanye made it clear to Travis that he needs to step it up big time,” our source added. “Kanye is protective of all of his family and wanted Travis to know that he better not let Kylie down in anyway once the baby arrives, ’cause Kanye will be watching.” And Travis certainly does not want to let Kanye down — especially considering the fact Kanye is his idol.

The 68-year-old is said to be thinking about adopting a baby with rumored girlfriend Sophia Hutchins.

Wracked with joint pain, Caitlyn Jenner is facing knee-replacement surgery — and it’s largely because the sex-swapping celeb still refuses to give up her beloved stiletto high heels , RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal! “Her doctors beg her to give up her stiletto collection, but she refuses!” spilled a pal. Even though doctors warn high heels are a major cause of knee pain, the 68-year-old plastic princess is willing to try anything aside from ditching the knee-busting footwear. Click through for more on the painful story!

Sources told RadarOnline.com the retired athlete’s chronic knee pain dates back to her days as a gold medal winner at the 1976 Olympics.

Training to become a world-champion runner, high jumper, long jumper and pole vaulter, an insider said Jenner caused damage to her knees.

“Cait’s paying for it now. Her knees stiffen up and ache,” said the source.

What’s more, the side effects of Jenner’s sex change haven’t helped. As RadarOnline.com previously reported, the reality starlet has spent $2 million of her reported $100 million fortune on beauty boosters, including plastic surgery.

Unfortunately, extensive liposuction on her tush and thighs has caused pain that shoots down her legs, worsening her knee pain.

For a while, Caitlyn managed to mask much of the pain with drugs, but the insider said she’s been wisely trying to cut back on them.

Now, although her reps deny it, she’s facing either knee-replacement surgery or — gasp — having to wear flats. And for high heel-loving Jenner, that’s no choice at all!

“Of course, the condition has worsened since Caitlyn began wearing heels full-time,” the pal said.

“Her whole life she was forced to wear heels only in the privacy of her bedroom, so the last thing she wants is to give them up just when she can finally wear them in public!”

Days after the 30-year-old songstress was photographed in an apparent argument with her rumored boyfriend, Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel, she seemed to lightheartedly respond to the tabloid story with a meme on her Instagram page.

“when u think u know more bout soccer 😼💪🏿 #worldcup2018,” Rihanna captioned the image of a male lion timidly backing away from the growling female feline, which somewhat resembled her passionately pointing fingers at Jameel while in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

Of course, it’s unknown if the duo were really feuding over soccer or the star was just trying to break the tension before gossip ran wild. What is clear is that Rihanna is a super fan of the tournament — she was even cheering from the stands when Germany bested Argentina 1-0 to win the 2014 World Cup.

The “Wild Thoughts” hitmaker remained coy while talking about her current relationship in Vogue‘s June cover story.

“I used to feel guilty about taking personal time, but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,” she explained.

Back in June 2017, the Ocean’s 8 star and Jameel were spotted kissing and grabbing coffee together. Since then, the two have been photographed together a few times — including in October, when a source told PEOPLE they were “canoodling all night” while grabbing dinner and bowling with a group of friends in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

""She's here!"" Kardashian declared in extra-large type on her Twitter account. ""We're so in love,"" she added.

Her tweet included a statement saying the baby was born via a surrogate on Monday at 12:47 a.m. and weighed 7 pounds, 6 ounces. She did not say where the baby was born, nor what she has been named.

""Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,"" the statement said. ""We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.""

She said the couple's two other children, North, 4, and Saint, 2, are ""thrilled to welcome their baby sister.""

Kardashian and West hired a surrogate because Kardashian's doctors strongly advised her not to go through a third pregnancy, as she discussed on her show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

She suffered from placentaaccreta, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition that makes childbirth difficult because the placenta is attached too deeply to the uterine wall.

But she wanted a third baby and her desire grew stronger in the wake of her traumatic experience as the victim of an armed robbery in Paris in October 2016.

The last thing Kate Middleton wants is to see her husband, the future King of England, party with models or dance like a fool for the world to see. Even though she’s been trying to hide her frustrations with William by putting a smile on her face in public, their relationship behind closed doors is a different story. The Duchess is hoping that with the right kind of counseling sessions, she can slowly but surely learn how to trust William again.

To make matters worse, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been trying their best to show the world that their marriage is absolutely fine. But, a lot of critics say that the harder they try to appear normal, they end up looking both insincere and staged. Kate Middleton doesn’t want to pull the plug on her royal marriage. At this point, she’s willing to do just about anything to make William focus more on their marriage than his own selfish needs.

Prince William and Kate Middleton rarely look like a happy couple in public. Even though they often smile and wave for the cameras during their royal engagements, their body language speaks volumes. Sure, everyone knows that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have to remain professional whenever they are in public, but that doesn’t mean William should completely ignore his wife or refuse to show her any gestures to say that they are still madly in love with one another.

So far Buckingham Palace has not made any comments about the state of Prince William and Kate Middleton’s marriage. In the meantime, don’t forget to check back with CDL for all the latest news and updates on the royal family right here.

-4214543640,Prince George Is Reportedly Getting More Security Following an ISIS Threat,"Prince George is getting heightened security at school and around London after being targeted by an ISIS threat, TMZ reports. There will reportedly be ""beefed up"" security at his school, St. Thomas's Battersea, and more officers will accompany him and his grandmother, Carole Middleton (Kate's mom), during their outings together.

Two weeks ago, an alleged supporter of the Islamic State group went on trial in London, accused of encouraging attacks on the four-year-old prince. Prosecutors said Husnain Rashid—a 32-year-old former mosque teacher in northwest England—provided an ""e-toolkit for terrorism"" and encouraged attacks on a range of targets, including ""injecting poison into supermarket ice creams and targeting Prince George at his first school.""

The Guardian reports that one of Rashid's posts included a photo of George, his school, and the message, ""Even the royal family will not be left alone."" Last week, after previously saying he did nothing wrong, Rashid admitted to a number of terror offenses, including encouraging terrorism, according to CNN.

Prince George—the eldest child of Prince William and Kate Middleton, and third in line for the throne—was recently seen at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding on May 19, where he served as a page boy. He was more recently spotted with his mother and sister, Princess Charlotte, for an outing in Norfolk, England, last week.

According to TMZ, Prince George's next appearance will be at Trooping the Colour on Sunday with the rest of the royal family at Buckingham Palace. As expected, there'll be a ""bigger security presence than usual,"" according to the site.

The royal family is choosing not to lay low or retreat in the wake of the ISIS threat, a source close to the family told TMZ.

Fans of The Handmaid's Tale might be a little disappointed that Kylie may have unintentionally posted a major spoiler from the series on her Story. Quit reading now if you haven't yet made it through the second season.

Thanks to Kylie, some viewers caught a glimpse of a family photo from the series that featured Fred and Serena with a baby. The picture would obviously mean that Offred aka June (Elisabeth Moss) had her child, and that the baby ended up in the custody of the couple, not June.

The picture came just as Kylie attended the show's finale party, though it was oddly enough the only Handmaids-related content posted by the star. The decision to the post the picture has drawn mixed reactions, including ""What is Kylie Jenner trying to tell us by Instagramming this creepy portrait from the Handmaid’s Tale?"" and ""Wow If you're only a couple episodes into a Handmaid's Tale don't watch Kylie's story.""

One follower couldn't even believe that Kylie had been the one to spoil the show, tweeting, ""I haven’t finished s2 of Handmaid’s tale yet and Kylie Jenner just dropped a spoiler out of all places to see a spoiler ffs I’ve been avoiding everywhere."" Thankfully, this Twitter user found a way to laugh about the incident, writing, ""Big mood is Kylie Jenner posting the complete family portrait of The Waterford’s from The Handmaid’s Tale on her IG story.""

Although some viewers were rightfully a little upset, others definitely enjoyed the idea that they shared a binge-watch favorite with the celeb. ""TIL that Kylie Jenner also watches The Handmaid’s Tale so she won some cool points,"" one person shared. And one Twitter follower could even relate to the Kylie's love of the show, tweeting, ""Kylie fangirling over The Handmaid’s Tale is me af.""

Whether Kylie secretly meant anything by the photo or she was just excited to be at the premiere remains unclear, but as Noah Schnapp of Stranger Things recently demonstrated, sometimes, spoilers just happen.",fake

So many celebrity couples these days are getting engaged after dating for mere weeks. Yet Blake Shelton, 42, and Gwen Stefani, 48, are coming up on three years together this fall without getting betrothed. They’re wildly in love, yet the country singer still hasn’t put a ring on the beautiful blonde’s finger. It turns out that their incredible success is standing in the way of an engagement and marriage. “With Gwen’s Vegas residency and Blake’s constant touring and duties with The Voice there really isn’t anytime to get married. And instead of getting engaged and waiting forever to get married they want to be in a spot where they can do both quick and the way they want to do it,” a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

“Their careers just need a bit of a break before that happens and they aren’t interested in slowing down right now. So they just have to settle down to settle down,” our insider adds. Gwen just kicked off her Just A Girl Las Vegas residency at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood on June 29 and shows no sign of slowing down. Meanwhile Blake is busy with his Country Music Freaks tour through August. Then he segues into shooting the upcoming season of NBC’s The Voice.

The Blakester still took time out of his busy schedule to be there for Gwen’s opening night in Vegas. He sweetly sat with her three sons as he looked on in adoration of his talented lady. The “Hollaback Girl” singer even showed off backstage video on her Instagram of youngest son Apollo, 4, seated comfortably on Blake’s lap in her dressing room when she finished her show. They’re already like one big family without being married. In these days of quickie engagements like Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson after only three weeks of dating, it’s refreshing to see a couple who has taken so much time bonding and growing so close yet not feeling the rush into marriage.",fake

-4171564337,Kate Middleton Begging Prince William To Go To Couple’s Therapy Following Ski Trip Scandal?,"Kate Middleton and Prince William have been married for several years and have two children together, but their marriage has never been in more trouble. As such, we’re hearing that sources close to the royals are now alleging that Kate Middleton wants Prince William to go to couple’s therapy with her.

Couple’s therapy works for some marriages, and doesn’t work for others – but this is THE royal marriage we’re talking about. Prince William’s marriage to Kate Middleton is probably the most scrutinized marriage in the world, especially right now, and that attention will only make the idea of couple’s therapy more difficult to pull off.

For example, what therapist should they go to? What facility? Does the therapist come to the palace? Any way they try to slice this, the press getting even a whiff of this would lead to widespread speculation that Prince William and Kate Middleton are getting a divorce.

Right now, the palace press office is in overdrive trying to fix Prince William’s disastrous image, thanks to his Swiss rendezvous last week and clear disregard for protocol, tradition, or basic decency. His marriage to Kate Middleton is also clearly in tatters as a result, and any other wife might have left by know. However, Kate Middleton has worked most of her adult life to become a princess (they don’t call her waity Katie for nothing), and it’s going to take a lot more than this for her to throw that all away.

Besides, Prince William has always been extraordinary stubborn about getting what he wants, and he never, ever seems to learn from his mistakes. While his family likely instilled some sense of guilt into him after last week, he’s probably already reverted to behaving the way he always does – that is, with disregard to his reputation and his wife, and a lack of understanding towards the way royals are expected to behave. He thinks he’s being ‘modern’, when really, he’s just being spoiled and stubborn.

What do you guys think of the idea of Prince William and Kate Middleton attending couple’s therapy? Do you think it will help, or that they have already embarked on a slow limp towards divorce? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below and don’t forget to check CDL for more royals news and updates right here.

-4174987776,Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Are Going to Be More Private After Breakup Rumors,"Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are still very much an item, despite a recent report speculating that the couple had broken up. But don’t expect them to make any grand public appearances soon. Instead, the pair are going to be laying low for a while so they can have as much privacy as possible. Which means you might not see any cute couple antics on Instagram stories for a while.

According to the latest update on their relationship, Cyrus and Hemsworth are “very much still together and have just been trying to be more private about their relationship,” a source told E! News, adding, “They have been spending a lot of their time being low-key in Nashville lately, and come home to Malibu often to spend time with family.”

As it turns out, the reason Cyrus deleted all her Instagram posts—including ones with Hemsworth—is that she’s shifting how she presents herself to the world in anticipation of her next album, the followup to 2015’s Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz and 2017’s Younger Now. “Miley is working on new music and rebranding herself, hence why she deleted her Instagram photos,” the source says, “She is starting the process of a new music project and wants a clean slate.”

That clean slate may also include wedding plans, although as of now no date has been set. “Wedding planning has been a continuous conversation over the years but they have not locked in any set plans,” the source says. “Their family would love for them to finally tie the knot, and are very excited about it, but no one is pushing them. Miley is very simplistic when it comes to her ideas and does not want things to be an ordeal. Both Miley and Liam want to have children and they both want to be married but aren’t trying to rush the process.”

The last time Cyrus opened up about marriage, though, she said it wasn’t something she was necessarily interested in. “I’m just riding this out,” she said last fall. “I don’t envision marriage. I’m 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do.” This time, however, she’ll be doing much of that living behind closed doors.

“They definitely see marriage potential here. J.Lo loves that they have so much in common,"" the insider adds.

""They’re both parents and they’re both successful in business. Their lives, while busy, really complement each other.”

Well, if the source is to be believed it certainly sounds like J-Lo may soon become Mrs. A-Rod.

So what is it that has her so enamored with the former Yankee?

Many have cited Alex's many professional successes as among the main reasons that Jen is so drawn to him.

But cosidering this is the woman who dated Casper Smart for years, we don't think being independently wealthy is high on her list of requirements.

What really seems important to these two is that despite their busy schedules, they both make family and parenthood their top priorities.

The insider says that Alex loves everything about Jen - but he's particularly blown away by how good she is with his kids.

“Jennifer means the world to him and he wants everyone to know it,"" the source notes.

“His kids like her a lot and that's what means the most to him.""

The court papers obtained by PEOPLE stated, “the children not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,” and that Jolie, 43, could lose full custody of the kids if she doesn’t allow them to grow their relationships with Pitt.

Maddox, 16, his oldest son isn’t included in the timetable. That’s because according to the court, Maddox is old enough to decide for himself how much time he wants to spend with his father.

“He is a great dad and always loved being with his kids,” a Pitt source says. “He doesn’t talk badly about Angie, but he feels it’s her fault that the kids don’t want to spend more time with him.”

-4085747635,Report: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner settle divorce,"(WENN) -- Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have reportedly agreed on a settlement in their divorce.



According to editors at TMZ, the estranged couple has been locked in a complicated and time-consuming battle over their property, which has prevented their divorce from becoming final.

Ben and Jennifer did not have a pre-nuptial agreement in place, so all their earnings during their marriage had to split equally.

The superstar couple, who split in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children - Violet, 12, Seraphina, nine, and Samuel, six.

Sources told the gossip site that the final settlement will be filed with the court once Gone Girl star has finished his stay in rehab.



The 46-year-old actress showed up at Ben's Pacific Palisades home in California on Wednesday afternoon and allegedly begged him to get help for his ongoing alcohol abuse issues. She told waiting photographers to give the couple privacy, and said ""it was not a good time"".

Jennifer was then spotted leaving with the actor/director and a person believed to be a sober coach and drove Ben to an unnamed rehab facility.

Friends of the star tell Page Six Ben has been ""struggling"" with sobriety since breaking up with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus, and it was photographs obtained by The Blast showing him taking a delivery of alcohol that reportedly forced his ex to take action.

In recent days, the Justice League star has been linked to 22-year-old Playboy playmate Shauna Sexton.

Despite the fact they split in 2015, Jennifer and Ben have remained close, but the double Oscar winner was noticeably absent from his estranged wife's Hollywood Walk of Fame star unveiling ceremony on Monday.

Selena Gomez, 25, is seriously wishing Charlie Puth, 26, didn’t divulge their former relationship.

While they arrived separately, the two of them definitely left together.

Time will tell if Charlie’s big reveal will throw a wedge into Jelena’s relationship, but all signs point to the two of them continuing to make it work in 2018. Click here to see pics of celebs, including Selena and Justin, who got back together in 2017.

-4088771012,"Milo Ventimiglia on Jack's 'This Is Us' death, Mandy Moore's reaction","We're all still grieving the loss of Milo Ventimiglia's Jack Pearson on ""This Is Us,"" even though we're excited to see him return next season.

But as Ventimiglia recently told The Los Angeles Times, his death scene wasn't just hard on him — his co-star, Mandy Moore, was ""crying every day"" for ""four weeks.""

Jack's (Milo Ventimiglia) death scenes were particularly hard on Mandy Moore, who plays his wife, Rebecca, on ""This Is Us."" NBC

""What I understood in my scene is it's very much not about me,"" he explained. ""It's about what Mandy (who plays Jack's wife Rebecca) has to experience in finding that ultimate low ... Hearing my friend completely break, it almost felt like an out-of-body experience. It hurt; it was painful.""

Jack was a true hero for rescuing his family from a house fire, but ultimately succumbed once he was at the hospital, which meant Moore had a lot of emotional scenes and a lot of tears to shed.

""Poor Mandy had about four weeks where she was crying every day,"" he recalled.

We're going to miss seeing Jack and Rebecca snuggling! Ron Batzdorff/NBC

And it's not as if Ventimiglia was taking a nap, lying on the hospital bed while she wept over him. ""It's about remaining still,"" he said about playing dead. ""I just focus on a spot on the ceiling and relax the muscles in my face.""

Afterward, the ""This Is Us"" actor says he gave Moore some room to recover from all that crying.

""I just waited until she came and knocked on my trailer door (once filming was done),"" he said. ""We had a big hug and there was laughter and even a, 'Thank God that's over.'""

At least, until season three, when apparently we'll see him again!

Chandler, the incumbent in the backfield, rushed 94 times for 419 yards and three touchdowns in the Vikings’ final eight regular season games while adding another 16 receptions for 116 scoreless yards. Jones, who the team acquired earlier this offseason following his release by the Packers, is the presumed RB1 but is entering his age-29 season and is coming off a year in which he was limited to 11 games due to hamstring injuries. Both backs bring a three-down skillset to the backfield and would have fringe RB1 upside if the other were ever to miss time.

-9986525919,Kendall Jenner Alone On NYE: Why Blake Griffin Won’t Be With Her For Midnight Kiss,"Just like Kylie, it looks like Kendall Jenner will also be bringing in the new year alone. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why her boyfriend Blake Griffin will be MIA.

For Blake Griffin, 28, his sports career comes first. It seems like the superstar athlete will be bringing in the New Year playing basketball, instead of kissing his model girlfriend Kendall Jenner, 22, at midnight. “Blake has been injured for a bit but he is practicing again and looking to get back to playing very soon and ahead of schedule and he is looking for New Year’s Eve to be the day he returns. With that schedule, he may have to meet up with Kendall later than expected or not spend the holiday with her unless she goes to the game. But his intentions are more to get back to the team then to hang out with Kendall. He is eager to get back to his job,” a source close to Blake tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

This news should come as quite the treat for Blake’s teammates and fans, who feared he’d succumb to the “Kardashian Curse” or “Jenner Jinx.” After seeing what happened to fellow basketball players Lamar Odom, 38, and Kris Humphries, 32, many feared that dating Kendall would negatively impact Blake’s performance. Although Blake slammed those accusations, it’s clear that he’s taking no chances and is making basketball his number one priority.

Even though the couple will not be together for New Year’s Eve, Kendall will be able to spend time with Kylie Jenner, 20, who will also be without her beau, Travis Scott, 25. Travis will be preforming at LIV Nightclub in Miami, FL on Dec. 31. At least the sisters will have each other!

An insider tells In Touch exclusively that the iconic singer, 68, is preparing a prenup to make sure his daughter is protected financially should the controversial duo tie the knot.

“Lionel’s preparing a $200 million prenup,” the insider tells In Touch exclusively. “He hates Scott and has tried to tell Sofia to leave him, but she won’t.” With an estimated net worth of $200 million, Lionel is seeing fit that his daughter’s beau never sees any of it, once she inherits it. “Lionel is a multimillionaire and Sofia has a huge trust fund,” another source adds. “He doesn’t want Scott getting a cent of it!”

Of course, Scott doesn’t really have any reason to be a gold digger; with 15 seasons of reality TV and countless hosting gigs under his belt, he’s earned an impressive estimated net worth of $15 million himself.

In the past, Lionel has made his feelings about Scott and Sofia’s relationship known — while trying his best not to alienate his teenage daughter. “She’s 19. When you’re 19, you know everything. Is it going to be for life? I don’t know,” he said in February. “But for right now, it’s just a phase and I’m going to stand real still in the corner, get me a good drink and not make too much noise.”

Despite Scott’s long-standing issues with monogamy — and Lionel’s objections — Scott and Sofia recently celebrated their one-year anniversary. The two were first linked to one another in May 2017 after they were spotted getting cozy aboard a yacht in Cannes during the city’s revered film festival. The two have pretty much been inseparable ever since, with Sofia even spending a signifcant amount of time with Scott’s three children, Mason, 8, Penelope, 5, and Reign, 3.

Two years later, though, Mum couldn't save Harry from his party habits. When Bonas neglected to join Harry at the Memphis wedding of his pal, nightclub entrepreneur Guy Pelly, and hotel heiress Elizabeth Wilson in May 2014 – ""There was a bit of row about how much it was costing her,"" notes Nicholl – he left in what she calls ""a bit of a huff."" And to deal with his frustrations, he made a detour to Miami, where he and long-time pal Amanda Sheppard spent a night dancing in the VIP room of the celeb-beloved the Fountainebleau Miami Beach hotel. Because Harry always had what Nicholl describes as ""a flirty relationship"" with Sheppard, when Bonas learned about their closeness on the dance floor she was less than pleased. ""They agreed to meet up when Harry came back from Memphis to talk things through,"" writes Nicholl, ""but Cressida had already made up her mind that the relationship had run its course.""

Despite Harry's best efforts, he couldn't convince her to restart it. ""Harry didn't want things to end. He was in love with her and he tried to convince her they could make it work, but Cressida's mind was made up,"" says Nicholl. ""I think she really broke his heart.""

In an effort to mend it, Harry turned back to his other serious love. By the summer of 2015, Davy was fresh out of a romance with jeweler Charles Goode. So when Harry – in Africa for his philanthropic work – asked her to meet up in Cape Town, she agreed. But while their rendezvous was romantic, it wasn't the start of lasting union.

Kanye West's Holiday Photo with Kim Kardashian and Their Kids Looks More Somber Than Joyful

The Kardashians may not have released their annual holiday card this year, but that doesn't mean this famous family isn't in the Christmas spirit. Kanye West just shared a more casual and intimate photo of himself with wife, Kim Kardashian, and their children, North, 3, and Saint, 1.

The rapper shared the pic on Twitter Tuesday, along with the message, ""Happy Holidays."" The pic doesn't look as cheerful as you might expect from a holiday photo, but it's definitely glam enough to fit right into a major fashion magazine.

It's unclear where or when the photo was taken, but it's likely that it was during Kris Jenner's annual Christmas Eve party, which Kanye and Kim both attended, and she was seen wearing the same gold gown. Most of the Kardashian-Jenner fam were also at the bash, including Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, and Caitlyn Jenner, according to Us. John Legend, Babyface, and David Foster provided the music for the evening.

Kim and Kanye have kept a fairly low profile in recent months following the reality star's robbery at gunpoint in Paris in October and the rapper's reported hospitalization in November. The state of Kim and Kanye's marriage has also come into question recently. But amid all that, it looks like the family has stayed strong as they prepare to say goodbye to 2016 and ring in the new year.

The Blended star was spotted getting cozy with ex-husband Will Kopelman, leaving the world wondering if they are getting back together? The couple, who split in 2016 after four years of marriage, have been spending nights together, an insider tells In Touch.

“When Drew was filming Santa Clarita Diet, Will would fly into LA from NYC. Even though he had a hotel room, he ended up sleeping at Drew’s house from time to time. Then when she finished shooting in October, it became a more regular thing. They enjoy each other’s company,” revealed the insider.

“They’re both in great places in their lives,” says an insider. Spending so much time together has reminded Drew, 42, and Will, 40 — who share daughters Olive, 5, and Frankie, 3 — of the way things used to be. “It’s like it was at the beginning of their relationship, so relaxed and comfortable,” says the insider, adding that a reconciliation “is a real possibility.”

Drew revealed that she felt like the “biggest failure” after announcing her divorce. “Like, when you get divorced, you break up with somebody and you’re like, ‘Yeah, that didn’t work,’ and you get divorced, [but] when you get divorced you’re like, ‘I’m the biggest failure.

Swift decided to forgo her once-beloved Independence Day party for the second year in a row, instead celebrating America's 242nd birthday by splashing around in the ocean with her British beau.

The 28-year-old Reputation artist still managed to show her patriotic side in a red, white, and blue stripped two-piece bikini while swimming and snorkeling with the 27-year-old actor.

The pair enjoyed the temperate climate and calm waters at a luxury resort in Turks and Caicos, where they made the most of their romantic vacation. They even got a little cozy in the surf as Swift rode on Alwyn's back through the idyllic blue waters.

SBMF / BACKGRID

The pair's cozy ocean romp was a rare public outing for the couple. Despite being romantically linked since last May, they've only been spotted out and about together a handful of times.

While the lovebirds enjoyed the quiet, romantic holiday in relative privacy, fans of the pop icon were left wondering if this marked the end of Swift's Fourth of July party tradition.

For years now, the singer and her squad of besties -- which included super models, singers, actress and social media stars -- all gathered at Swift's Rhode Island estate for FOMO-inducing festivities that included barbecues, fireworks, patriotic inflatable bouncy houses and more.

However, amid her prolonged break from the public eye in the months before Reputation's release in November -- as well as her highly publicized feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and taking heat for not being as vocal against President Donald Trump as some fans would have liked -- Swift also skipped last year's Fourth of July celebration.

As some fans have suggested, it's possible Swift -- like many celebrities -- simply hasn't felt like celebrating the patriotic holiday. Or maybe its because she has been gearing up for and then subsequently performing in her massive Reputation Stadium Tour, and simply hasn't had time or energy to throw together a massive party. Only Swift herself can answer those questions.

Iggy Azalea, 26, knows a lot about heartbreak when it comes to dealing with men. Especially, those who are still connected to their exes. That said, The New Classic artist is trying to get word to Khloe Kardashian, 32, that Tristan Thompson, 25, may break her heart if she’s not careful.

“Iggy’s not trying to be salty or hate on Tristan but she’s hit up French [Montana], and told her he needs to put Khloe up on game and warn her that she’s putting herself at risk for serious heartbreak with him,” a source close to Iggy told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Iggy explained to French that these basketball players are no joke and don’t care whose heart they break in their quest to bang every girl that breathes.”

“Iggy still feels some type of way after Nick [Young] cheated on her and then on top of that got his baby mama pregnant – again,” the source continued. “She’s sticking to the girl code and would hate for Khloe to experience the same type of pain she did. She’s hoping French gets to her before it’s too late.”

As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, it’s really hard for KoKo to ignore the rumors that TT and his baby mama, Jordy Craig, are still hooking up.

When abroad, the newly single star attended the Louis Vuitton runway show during Paris Fashion Week, and while his pals might have been eager to hit the town and flirt with women, Theroux was friendly rather than flirty, according to the source.

“He felt confined by their relationship. He wasn't interested with Jen's everyday scheduled life of yoga classes, eating healthy,” the source continues. “Justin is a free spirit and loves his time alone. Justin had a need for independence.”

The video was taken on a boat on what looks like a vacation in Idaho, judging from Rodriguez's next two posts, which show the whole clan (her kids and his kids) together.

This isn't the first time Lopez and Rodriguez have enjoyed some quality time with each other's kids. Both have two children from previous marriages, and they both seem like they've very close with their kids. Lopez has 10-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex-husband Marc Anthony, and Rodriguez has 10-year-old Ella and 13-year-old Natasha with ex-wife Cynthia Rodriguez.

According to the US publication, a baby isn’t the couple’s only major news.

The insider spilled the couple are also gearing up for a big move. After splitting his time between their two homes, Danny is finally moving back into the family’s Malibu mansion.

‘Prior to the baby news, Julia and Danny were at each other’s throats,’ says the insider, explaining that the actress felt that Danny ‘wasn’t there for her’ after her mother’s passing in 2015.

Meanwhile, the insider says that Danny was ‘jealous’ over rumours that Julia was spending time with her Pretty Woman co-star Richard Gere.

‘This baby has revived their commitment to each other and reminded Julia how much she loves Danny and vice versa.’

‘They’re so excited they can’t wait for what the future holds.’

-9637093116,Fan Sues Gwen Stefani & Live Nation for Stampede That Left Her With a Broken Leg,"A North Carolina Gwen Stefani fan is suing the No Doubt singer and concert promoter Live Nation after an accident at the PNC Music Pavilion left her with a broken leg.

Lisa Stricklin filed the lawsuit in federal court Friday, alleging that during the July 23, 2016, concert, the pop star encouraged fans sitting on the lawn section to move toward the reserved seating area to be closer to the stage.

“Just fill in anywhere you like! Who cares about your lawn chairs? You can get new ones!” Stefani allegedly told fans during the show.

“This announcement created a stampede rush of patrons from the lawn seating area through the reserved seating area and toward the front of the performance stage, with people knocking over and breaching the security barricades and other security matter, jumping over seats in the reserved seating area, and pouring in through the aisles separating the various sections of the reserved seating area,” the suit reads. Stricklin “was trampled by the rush of patrons and into a wall along the reserved seating area, causing her severe physical injuries,” including a broken tibia.

Trending on Billboard

While Stefani never apologized for the stampede, according to the lawsuit, she did allegedly tell fans, “I got in so much trouble for telling you guys to come up here!”

Stricklin is suing Stefani for allegedly causing the stampede and Live Nation for failing to protect her. She’s asking a judge to force Live Nation and Stefani to each pay her $75,000 and is seeking unspecified punitive damages from Stefani. Billboard reached out to Live Nation as was told the company could not comment on pending litigation.",fake

People have been wondering whether or not Rihanna is pregnant after the Bajan bad girl was spotted out over the last few weeks looking a little different. The 29-year-old has been dressing a lot more covered up as of late. Her tops are baggier, she’s been holding things in front of her stomach, covering up her stomach completely, and she’s even been seen wearing fur coats in California this month, and we know the temperature is rising pretty much everywhere. But we know what you’re thinking: “She can’t just have put on a few pounds?” Or maybe you’re thinking, “Who would be the father??”

Well, an alleged “Rihanna insider” told HollywoodLife.com that the rumors aren’t true. “Rihanna isn’t pregnant, sorry to disappoint everyone, but, nope. She has something going on, but it’s private. The speculation is tough for Rihanna. But, she knows she’ll be back to her regular self soon enough.”

We don’t 100 percent believe that Ri Ri is pregnant ourselves. And as my friend said, she could just be trying to start new fashion trends that include more belts, denim and loose tanks. There’s nothing wrong with that. Or, as the source claims, it could be a temporary health change. Only the star really knows.

According to the waitress, who now stars on Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules, Eddie was already dating LeAnn, 30.

“As months go by, Eddie gets separated. He then contacts me to go out for drinks,” Scheana says. “I believed he was separated, so I was happy to go out with him again. But shortly into trying to hang out with him I find out about LeAnn, and I felt like such an idiot!”

Scheana Marie Recalls Meeting Eddie Cibrian

Scheana spoke with the website about when she first met Eddie and revealed the surprising source who informed her about Eddie’s lies. “Originally, I met him seven years ago. When a really good-looking guy with big dimples wants to take you out for drinks your first question isn’t ‘Are you married because you don’t have a ring on your finger?'” she says.

“We hung out, it was quite casual and about six months in, my mom saw an article and was like, ‘That Eddie guy you are dating, is his last name Cibrian and is he on Third Watch?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, what do you hear?’ And she told me that he and his wife are expecting their second child!”

Scheana Confronts Eddie About His Lies

Scheana says that she confronted the philandering actor to find out the truth, and he admitted to his lies via text message! “He was like, ‘I’m so sorry I lied to you.’ He then switched the conversation and said, ‘By the way, are you still doing the acting thing? I have a project I’m funding, and there’s a role for you that would be great.'”

The waitress-turned-reality star says that, since their last run-in, she and Eddie haven’t spoken. “I have no interest in talking to him again,” she says.

Do you believe Scheana’s claims that Eddie tried to cheat on LeAnn with her, HollywoodLifers?

The news comes two years after the couple separated - although they only made their separation public in 2016.

Summer and Casey have two sons together - 13-year-old Indiana and nine-year-old Atticus.

The soon-to-be-ex-husband and wife originally began dating back in 1999 - when Summer was in a relationship with someone else, but her brother Joaquin encouraged Casey to pursue her.

""She was going out with someone else and I said, 'Man, she's cute,' and [Joaquin] said, 'You should see if she'll go out with you… don't worry about that dude,’” Casey told The Daily Beast in 2013.

Gomez, 25, was recently was pictured kissing Bieber, 23, at a hockey game following their numerous dates, while The Weeknd, 27, was spotted leaving Hadid's (21) apartment on 14 November.

Although The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) has been trying to reconnect romantically with the model, he sparked dating rumours with a dinner date with Katy Perry, 33, at Madeo in West Hollywood on 20 November.

Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt on Sept. 19 and HollywoodLife.com has obtained the actual divorce documents. Here, take a look at the papers in which she shockingly asks for no spousal or child support.

Just hours after it was revealed that Angelina, 41, filed for divorce from Brad, 52, on Sept. 20, HollywoodLife.com obtained the divorce papers that laid out exactly what Angie is asking for as she’s ending her marriage of just over two years.

Angelina cites “irreconcilable differences” in the 11-page divorce papers. But, she makes no demands for child support for their six children, nor any support for herself. She is, however, asking for full physical custody of the couple’s children, Shiloh, Knox, Vivienne, Zahara, Maddox, and Pax, and joint legal custody.

She’s also released a statement through her lawyer giving her reason for ending the marriage. “Angelina has filed for dissolution of the marriage,” Robert Offer, Angelina’s entertainment attorney, said in a statement on Sept. 20, per Harper’s Bazaar. “This decision was made for the health of the family. She will not be commenting, and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time.”

Although “irreconcilable differences” is the reason cited in the papers, sources also said that Brad has a weed addiction as well as a possible alcohol issues. On top of that, he has an “anger problem” — all of which serve as a major threat to their young children. It was also reported that Angelina was frustrated with Brad’s “methods” of parenting.

Brad and Angelina have been together since 2004 and married since 2014, so there’s certainly a lot that will need to be worked out in their split. Whether Angelina will be granted everything she is requesting is yet to be determined, but we’ll surely be keeping tabs on this shocking breakup!

The exes appeared to have moved on with their current partners Anderson East and Gwen Stefani, but they still get on each other’s nerves. An insider told OK! that the “Vice” hitmaker can’t stand seeing her ex-husband and his girlfriend flaunt their romance. She despises seeing him look so happy with his sexy lover.

There is reportedly a lot of frustration between Miranda and Blake, and they are now letting it show. A source claimed that the 34-year-old singer has accused the 41-year-old country superstar of using his The Voice co-star to make her jealous. He allegedly retaliated by telling her that Gwen has everything that she does not. Hollywood Life reportedly reached out to Lambert and Shelton’s reps regarding this controversy, but no word from them yet.

The former power couple of country music has avoided talking about their divorce and instead, use their music to express their feelings. Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton both claim that they are happy with their current partners Anderson East and Gwen Stefani. However, they still continue to throw shade at each other, which means that they haven’t totally moved on.

During her concert in South Carolina, Miranda performed her hit song “Little Red Wagon” but changed the lyric “I live in Oklahoma” to “I got the hell out of Oklahoma.” That’s where she used to live with her ex-husband. The next day, Blake reportedly retaliated by doing a cover of “All My Exes Live in Texas” by George Strait at the Crash My Playa festival, and this could be a diss to his ex-wife who hails from Texas.

Miranda Lambert may not have intentionally slammed Blake Shelton when she changed a line from her song because she expressed how much she wanted to get over her divorce.

James is stuck between a rock and a hard place—if he responds then it’s like he’s disparaging those women who are speaking out, and if he doesn’t then some may think he assumes a level of guilt.” Although five women have come forward to accuse the actor of alleged sexual misconduct since Ally Sheedy cryptically tweeted about him during the 2018 Golden Globe Awards, he has denied the accusations. Check out some of the best pics from the 2018 Women’s March here!

Despite the claims, James has been supporting the Time’s Up movement and doesn’t want to be stereotyped from the recent headlines about him. “James was horrified that he was branded as some kind of sexual aggressor—as far as he’s concerned that couldn’t be further from the truth,” the source continued. “He’s a big supporter of the movement, and he’s really happy that women are finally being given a voice—if he has to take a hit, for something he swears he hasn’t done, then so be it. James knows what’s in his heart, and he knows that he’s a good person.”

With James claiming to have his own story about his past, there’s been high anticipation about where the accusations toward him will lead. Only time will tell with this situation but one thing remains in tact: women in the entertainment industry and beyond are fighting back hard to stand up for what they believe in! In addition to Scarlett, high profile actresses such as Natalie Portman, 36, Eva Longoria, 42, and Alyssa Milano, 45, spoke out about their own personal stories at the Women’s March in LA and Atlanta.

Nicki Minaj isn’t a stranger to pregnancy rumors, but this new report by Media Takeout is claiming the “Anaconda” rapper is definitely expecting this time around! According to the site, “[Nicki] found out she was pregnant during Thanksgiving and supposedly she’s supposed to announce her bundle of joy around the Grammys.” They added that Nas, Nicki’s current beau, is the father, but pointed out that there may be trouble in paradise. While Nicki’s been quieter than usual on social media since breaking the internet with her Paper Magazine cover, she tweeted, “Have you ever noticed how confused people act when you start treating them EXACTLY how they’ve been treating you?” MTO’s report says this is a direct reference to Nas being stubborn and moody. Hmm! They also claim that Nas told his ex Kelis that he and Nicki were expecting, and “Kelis is jealous about not being Nas ONLY baby’s mother – so she’s messing with their custody arrangement.”

This report claiming Nicki is pregnant comes just a month and a half after she tweeted to her fans, “Y’all want the album or the baby? Cuz ch- y’all ain’t bout to get both.” Whoa. As previously noted, this isn’t the first time Nicki has been subject to pregnancy rumors. Last February, Nicki posted a photo of herself with a baby bump and sparked baby rumors, but it was only an edit by her fans that she reposted.

-9489003614,Kylie Jenner Reportedly An Emotional Wreck Following Caitlyn Jenner's Transition,"Not all of Caitlyn Jenner's kids are dealing with her transition gracefully.

While the world has been on an inspiration high since Jenner's AMAZING speech at the July 15 ESPYS, Kylie Jenner is reportedly not as thrilled. According to a source, Kylie has felt more ""alone"" than ever following Cait's change.

[ Related: Surprise! Almost All Of The Kardashian & Jenner Kids Came Out To Support Caitlyn At The ESPYS! ]

A source explained:

""Kylie has not been taking this whole thing well at all and cannot come to terms with the fact that her father is now Caitlyn.""

Hmm. Considering the youngest Jenner didn't show up to a recent Father's Day event, we're not surprised to learn she's feeling this way.

The insider added:

""Caitlyn has been getting more attention than anyone in the family and perhaps that is part of what bothers Kylie. But also she feels incredibly alone lately and is barely coping. She used to be daddy's girl but ever since her dad transitioned, Caitlyn does not seem to have the same time for Kylie that Bruce once did. It bothers her a lot and last night while everyone in the family was crying tears of joy, her tears were of sorrow.""

We can understand why the 17-year-old is feeling left out — the 65-year-old is more in demand than ever! Long gone are the days that the Olympian was chauffeuring Kylie and Kendall Jenner around Calabasas!

We just hope Kyles will eventually come around to Caitlyn…we know there's a lot of love there. Hang in there, you guys!

-947881619,Cara Delevingne cuddles up to Paris Jackson in bed,"Cara Delevingne cuddles up to Paris Jackson as the pals share cozy snaps from bed together.

The pair reportedly met at the 2017 MTV Movie and TV Awards and have struck up a close friendship with constant rumors of a romance.

Paris shared the candid snaps of their girls’ night in on her Instagram account.

Giving fans a rare glimpse into her home, the only daughter of Michael Jackson captioned a shot of Cara: “A R T.”

The 25-year-old actress and model jumped on the bed, surrounded by kitsch artwork curated by Jackson.

Delevingne and Jackson watched 2015 romance movie “Carol” as they tucked into fresh strawberries.

Delevingne and Jackson first fueled romance rumors when they were spotted leaving a nightclub hand-in-hand in November 2017.

The following month Delevingne invited Jackson as her guest of honor to the Christmas Burberry X Bash in London – where they were again seen trying to sneak out together.

The Sun then reported that the pair spent much of the Christmas break together as they hopped between London, Italy and the Czech Republic, where Delevingne was filming her Amazon series “Carnival Row.”

A source said at the time: “They’re both really into their music and have been spending nights singing and jamming on the guitar.

“It’s early days, and Cara doesn’t really have time for a proper relationship due to her non-stop filming commitments with ‘Carnival Row,’ but there’s no denying there’s a spark.”

The women have been seen looking close during fashion week in London in February, and were once again spotted holding hands as they went for dinner.

Delevingne has said of her “liquid” sexuality: “As a child I used gay as a bad word, as in, ‘That’s so gay.’ All my friends did.

“[My parents] have been so, so supportive. I’m obviously in love, so if people want to say I’m gay, that’s great. But we’re all liquid – we change, we grow.”",fake

Uh oh! As Kylie Jenner‘s due date approaches, her baby daddy Travis Scott, 25, is still pretty much absent from her life. Unlike her ex Tyga, 28, who was always there catering to the reality star’s every whim. Now she wondering if she picked the wrong guy to have a baby with. “Kylie is dealing with major regrets over her pregnancy as her due date quickly approaches. She is second guessing the biggest decision in her life, having a baby with Travis. As her relationship with her baby daddy is so rocky and uncertain, Kylie is starting to think he she made the wrong decision by deciding to have a baby with someone who is no longer present much in her life,” a source close to the cosmetics queen tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

“She has been having trouble sleeping late at night, worrying about her decisions. Kylie can’t help but wonder how things would be different if her baby was Tyga’s. She misses her ex Tyga, who was always caring and present, and she is beginning to think it should have been Tyga’s baby, not Travis'” our insider continues.

The 20-year-old’s nearly three year relationship with Tyga had just ended for good a month before she started dating Travis back in April of 2017. She got pregnant after they were together for only a few months, which isn’t exactly a solid foundation. At two months most couples haven’t even said their “I love you’s” yet, let alone find out they’re becoming parents together. With Tyga, she knew she had a guy who loved her deeply and was always there for her, even if they did fight a lot. Plus he showed that he’s already a great dad with his son King Cairo, 4. Who knows if Travis will make a wonderful father or not, but so far he hasn’t exactly been the most supportive partner to someone he’s going to share a child with.

HollywoodLifers, do you think Tyga would have made a better baby daddy for Kylie? Or do you think Travis will come through as a decent parent?",fake

As for the state of his friendship with JAY today, Kanye says, ""We good. We texting each other, positive energy.""

Get a man who can do both. One of Hollywood’s sexiest actors is also the world’s greatest father. Where do we get one of those? George Clooney, 56, “is such a natural parent — it’s amazing how he is with the twins,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “After all the years he protested that he wasn’t cut out for parenthood, it’s mind blowing how good he is. George is so patient and calm around the babies, even when they’ve been on an hour-long crying tear! When he picks the babies up they immediately calm down.” Not even wifey Amal Clooney, 39, can understand his magical touch.

What’s even sweeter is that the Hail, Caesar! actor isn’t afraid of getting his hands dirty — literally! There’s no task too daunting whether it’s diaper changes or midnight feedings. “George will be an absolutely wonderful father, Amal will be — and already is — a magnificent mother,” his father Nick Clooney gushed to Good Morning Britain on June 8. “He will be hands on entirely and he will do it with humor and with joy.” That’s incredible news for the human rights activist too, who took a break from court hearings and official law business to enjoy maternity leave for the next few weeks.

With Amal expected to head back to work in January, she’s trying to get all the rest she can. Of course that isn’t easy with two newborn babies in the house. The couple “are beyond tired,” our source continues. “Sometimes they feel like zombies they’re so tired, but they wouldn’t change their new life for all the money in the world. George really didn’t think he could be this happy and content, it’s like his whole life has been preparation for being a dad.” Awww! Hearts currently melting.

-9458505194,Jennifer Garner Dating Chris Pine After Ben Affleck Divorce?,"Has Jennifer Garner finally moved on from Ben Affleck? The actress is allegedly dating a new Hollywood heartthrob after Ben went public with his relationship with Lindsay Shookus.

According to Hollywood Life, Jennifer Garner is reportedly dating Chris Pine. The couple are allegedly involved in a super-secret romance, and they’re not ready to go public with the relationship just yet. A source reveals the pair have been secretly meeting up whenever their schedules will allow them to do so and that they’re “attraction” to one another is “growing.”

Jennifer Garner and Chris Pine reportedly met each other at a charity event back in 2011. The couple allegedly got along great and bonded over their “shared sense of humor.” However, at the time of their meeting, Garner was still married to husband Ben Affleck.

Now that Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck’s marriage is officially over, Jen’s relationship with Chris Pine has blossomed. A mutual friend of the pair, who is said to have starred with Pine in the film This Means War, reportedly set the two up. The couple went on their first official date back in May at LA’s Sunset Tower. An insider claims that Jennifer was very nervous, but Chris “kept the mood light,” which put the actress at ease. The two ended up having a “wonderful” time together.

Since their first date, the couple have reportedly been spending time together by sneaking out for low-key dinner dates, hikes, and hanging out at his LA home. The insider adds that Chris Pine has been like a “breathe of fresh air” for Jennifer Garner following her rocky marriage to Ben Affleck. He reportedly makes her feel young and sexy again, and he’s allegedly thrilled to have really connected with someone on a romantic level.

However, Jennifer Garner is reportedly keeping things light with Chris Pine, and she’s not taking the relationship too seriously just yet. Meanwhile, when Ben Affleck found out about the romance, he reportedly “freaked out,” but the two now have a mutual respect for one another’s relationships.

What are your thoughts on Jennifer Garner allegedly dating Chris Pine after her divorce with Ben Affleck?

Related Story Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield Just Reunited

Since he split from Jennifer Aniston in February, Theroux has been linked to a number of different women, including Selena Gomez, Aubrey Plaza, and Petra Collins.

And now, rumors that Theroux is dating Stone have surfaced after the pair were photographed vacationing together at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Saint-Paul-De-Vence, and attending the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2019 show at The Maeght Foundation this week.

Getty Images

Stone and Theroux were also photographed with the actress, Laura Harrier.

Theroux and Stone are co-stars in Netflix's forthcoming series, Maniac, and have been spending a lot of time together as a result. However, rumors that the pair might be more than friends started earlier this month when they were seen leaving a Met Gala after-party together.

E! also notes that Theroux shared a photo of Stone in one of his Instagram Stories earlier this month, as the pair posed with Jonathan Van Ness from Netflix's Queer Eye reboot. Theroux did his best to quell dating rumors, though, captioning the photo, ""Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs.""

To make matters more confusing, Theroux was also seen looking extremely close to Harrier, who is on vacation with Stone, and also attended the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2019 show.

Theroux previously shared a photo of Harrier on his Instagram account, taken at a Met Gala after-party. Basically, it's a little unclear whether Theroux is actually dating Stone or Harrier, but you can review all of the photos for yourself over at the Daily Mail.

-941805037,Celebrities Join Tax March in Protest of Donald Trump,"Thousands are taking the streets to protest President Donald Trump on Tax Day.

The so-called Tax March is smaller in scale than the Women’s March that drew an estimated 5+ million protesters worldwide following Trump’s inauguration in January, but still drawing vocal crowds across the country.

Those protesting today are primarily calling for Trump to disclose his tax returns. During his candidacy, Trump promised he would release his taxes after the IRS completed their audit of them. He has not. (Note, Trump’s 2016 taxes will immediately be under audit this year.)

Critics believe that Trump’s tax returns may disclose personal or financial ties that influenced the presidential campaign and/or the current administration. This comes as a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation is underway looking at ties between top Trump aides and Russia.

As with the Women’s March, some celebrities are protesting via social media. Here are some of their responses.

Popular on Variety

At a rally in New York City, Sarah Silverman addressed Trump directly. “Show us your f–king taxes, you emotional child.”

13 director Ava Duvernay shared photos of various signs, including one that echoed Silverman’s expletive and another with a “Game of Thrones” reference.

Andy Richter also tweeted a graphic poster.

My daughter couldn't make it today but she made a sign for us to carry #TaxMarch #taxmarchla pic.twitter.com/QtbkzyRRd2 — Andy Richter (@AndyRichter) April 15, 2017

“Captain America” star Chris Evans simply posted “liar” and a clip to an interview where Trump said he would release his taxes.

Actor Ike Barinholtz thanked the protesters and called out the fact that the President was making his 17th golf trip this weekend after 12 weeks in office.

Thank you to all the folks at the #TaxMarch 🇺🇸 You ALL love America more than that stupid idiot sitting in his shitty golf club right now — Ike Barinholtz (@ikebarinholtz) April 15, 2017

Happy early Father's Day! (June 17th, to those of you who aren't paying attention; don't worry, dad has probably lost track too.) Following a box-office run where it made just over its budget with a $33 million gross, Death Wish 2018 is coming home digitally on 4K Ultra HD May 22nd, and then Blu-ray/DVD/VOD June 5th. It's all in good time to pay tribute to your dad by letting him imagine he'd be an action hero on your behalf, if circumstances ever arose.

The Blu-ray will include a commentary track by director Eli Roth and producer Roger Birnbaum, a grindhouse-style trailer, a featurette focusing on Roth's direction, extended scenes featuring deejays Mancow and Sway, and deleted scenes with optional Roth/Birnbaum commentary. I'm pleased to premiere one of those scenes right here. It takes place shortly after Paul Kersey (Willis) has had an uncomfortable run-in at a school sporting event for his daughter:

You can see why it didn't quite make the final cut--it feels like it's over-telling you Paul is a pacifist rather than showing you, and frankly nobody is going into this movie with any doubts about how things end up. As an audience member, you're waiting for him to get pushed over the line and do what Bruce Willis does, and it's a waste of time to take too long establishing the line itself.

It'll be interesting to see what else got deleted, though--perhaps there was an earlier cut with more ambiguity, one that played against Roth's natural instincts for grindhouse exploitation fare. Really, though, if you want something less gung-ho, watch the Charles Bronson version. The remake is unapologetic righteous fury, and will be best enjoyed if you know that going in.",fake

In the past Portia has caved in and let her control things but lately she is wanting to take back her life.

According to the Feb. 17th print edition of Star magazine the couple had a huge blowout late last month because Portia refused to attend a taping of Ellen’s talk show. There was no real reason other than the fact that Portia wanted to get some stuff done for the couple. Reportedly Ellen freaked out and insisted that Portia was completely unsupportive. On this occasion not only did Portia not back down, but she took off her wedding ring. After Ellen left for the studio Portia was photographed out walking her dogs, ringless.

Her two and a half year relationship with Matthew Rutler appears to be solid and happy, but Star magazine claims that this is only smoke and mirrors. A source reveals, “Their relationship is convenient. It was always casual, very on and off, and not something Christina saw a future in.” The magazine further alleges that Aguilera is “ready for a new man” and that she’s “already on the prowl for a replacement.”

Aguilera’s temporary departure from The Voice signaled a massive change in her career. Not only did she regain the humungous success she once had, but she also built a completely new fan base from scratch. Aguilera has also been steadfast in her romantic affairs, but there’s still an opportunity for artistic ambition to give her relationship with Rutler a death blow.

This is, however, highly unlikely.

The source continues, “Christina plans on being ‘officially’ single by the time she begins promoting her new album and tour. She’s wasting no time setting her sights on a number of eligible bachelors. [She] wants an A-list boyfriend to complement her newfound confidence. All that’s missing is a hot, headline-stealing man on her arm. She’s already compiled a wish list that includes Colin Farrell and Jared Leto.”

Aguilera’s pop ballads speak of heartache and forlorn memories, so we doubt she’d put this spell on Rutler, especially since they’ve been dating for as long as Taylor Swift’s career.

It’s up to you to decide whether there’s any veracity to this story. What do you think? Do you think Aguilera is about to kick Rutler to the curb and headhunt a hot one? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

""Sources"" Say Justin Started Texting Sel After His Split from Jennifer

Apparently, ~sources~ from tabloids—which we're only referencing here in the interest of covering all the bases about how these rumours cropped up in the first place—claim Justin started texting Selena after their respective breakups: ""It was kind of an open secret that Justin was sweet on Selena when he and Jen hung out with her.""

Is it getting hot in here — or is it just the sizzling passion between Jennifer Lopez, 48, and Alex Rodriguez, 41? Most definitely the second one. There’s a lot to love when it comes to the former New York Yankees baseball player, like his gentlemanly character, well-tailored suits, and the fact that he’ll go to a hot yoga class with his girlfriend (which is very difficult to make men do, believe me I’ve tried). But the thing Jen adores most about him is his make out skills! “She loves his kissing ability,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Someone call the doctor ’cause this girl’s got a fever!

“Alex is a very passionate man — it turns her on and make her go wild,” the source continues. “Jen seriously thinks his kissing ability is next level! The fact that she gets everything else is just the icing on the cake.” The Latina singer has hit the jackpot with this one, and you’d have to be blind not to notice how their sexual chemistry translates into different outside-the-bedroom activities. They do hot yoga together, take long bike rides in the morning, and even hit the gym in matching workout gear! So far we can count eight different times that they’ve been couple clones.

Pretty self-explanatory, Couple Clones are when two people in a relationship dress alike. The pop star and the MLB hunk have matched in ivory overcoats, dark denim, white T-shirts and blue jeans, pastel colors, navy slacks, and MORE. Even their gym outfits are often in tune with each other! Do they plan this on purpose? If Jen ever gets tired of kissing Alex (which we doubt will ever happen), at least she can raid his closet!

-9211668568,Why Did Brad Pitt Dye His Hair? It Wasn't Because He Wanted To Jump On The Silver Hair Trend,"At 52 years old, it's not exactly surprising that Brad Pitt has gray hair, however, it is a little more surprising to learn that he dyed it that way — on purpose. On Sunday, the actor debuted gray hair while out in Paris, which caused a frenzy on the Interwebs. However, what we really want to know is why did Brad Pitt go gray?

It turns out that Brad Pitt is not turning into a silver fox, but is only playing a silver fox for a role in his upcoming Netflix Original film War Machine , where the father of six plays a U.S. Army general.

Generally, Pitt has brown locks, but I'm honestly curious as to whether he has to dye his hair to get his signature brown shade. My guess is he's got a handful of gray hairs, otherwise, he has some really good genes. OK, sorry, clearly Brad Pitt is blessed with good genetics, whether he has to dye his hair to keep if from naturally going gray.

Luckily for Pitt, gray hair has continued to remain trendy ever since Kylie Jenner rocked some long silver extensions in 2014, even though the gray hair trend has been making random appearances since 2007, and if you remember correctly from history class, silver hair was very popular during Marie Antoinette's era. Anyway, it's clear that Pitt looks good regardless of his hair color, so rock on.

Although I'm loving the new silver look, his natural brown hue is not too bad on the eyes.

Or when he let his hair grow out and the ends were a sun-kissed blonde...

And then there was that time he went REALLY blonde (and still made it look good):

-9169815700,"Royal Baby's Name Is Louis Arthur Charles, Will and Kate Announce","Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge welcomed the newest addition to the Royal Family on Monday. Now, Will and Kate Middleton have announced what the baby boy’s name is.

The royal baby name is Louis Arthur Charles, Kensington Palace announced on Twitter Friday. His royal title will be His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles.



The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge. pic.twitter.com/4DUwsLv5JQ — The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) April 27, 2018

While the royal baby name odds on Louis were 33/1 could make it appear to be a surprising choice, the names Louis, Arthur and Charles have significance within the royal family. Louis was the name of Prince Phillip’s grandfather, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, as well as Prince Charles’ great-uncle Earl Louis Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the IRA in 1979. Louis is also a middle name for both Prince William and Prince George.

As for Prince Louis’ middle names, Arthur was a middle name of Queen Elizabeth’s late father King George VI and is a middle name to both William and Prince Charles. Arthur of course also brings to mind King Arthur (though experts say there’s no evidence of any actual historical king behind the famous Arthurian legends).

Prince Louis shares his third name, Charles, with his grandfather, Prince Charles.

Louis Arthur Charles is the third child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who welcomed a son, Prince George, in 2013 and a daughter, Princess Charlotte, in 2015.

Ahead of Louis Arthur Charles’s birth, the couple announced via the official Kensington Palace Twitter account that Middleton was expecting in September 2017, but opted not to reveal the baby’s gender (something they had done with their previous two children) ahead of the birth.

The baby’s birth is just one of a series of exciting life events for the royal family this spring, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be getting married next month on May 19th.",fake

A tabloid claimed that the “Ocean’s Eleven” actor was spotted hovering near the actress because he wanted to have a conversation with her. When Robbie was finally free to talk, Pitt grabbed the chance and made sure that they could be together for hours. The tabloid even claimed that Pitt is smitten over the actress.

However, rumor debunking site Gossip Cop recently clarified that Pitt did not hover around Robbie until they could talk at the party. The actor did not also actively pursue the “I, Tonya” star.

The link between Pitt and Robbie started after it was revealed that the latter is in talks to star in Quentin Tarantino’s upcoming movie, “Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.” The film also stars Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.

Meanwhile, the same tabloid also falsely claimed that Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have gotten back together recently. Aniston announced her split from Justin Theroux on Feb. 15, but the estranged couple have not been together since the end of last year.

Pitt, on the other hand, is still finalizing his divorce from Angelina Jolie. The “Maleficent” star filed a motion to end her marriage to Pitt in September 2016 following an incident that took place on a plane. Pitt allegedly had a brawl with his son, Maddox. The FBI investigated Jolie’s complaints, but they did not find any evidence of abuse against the actor. Pitt was later on cleared.

A source told US Weekly last month that Pitt and Jolie are amicable towards each other for the sake of their six children.

“This was a request to extend the temporary judge. They want things to remain private and they want things to be amicable. They both have kept the focus on their family. It hasn’t been easy but they are both committed to resolving it privately,” the source said.

Pitt and Jolie are parents to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and Vivienne and Knox, 9.

Being that she is a thinner build, when she flexes her muscles that’s when those veins are more pronounced and you can see them more. The vein that you’re seeing on her leg is the great saphenous vein. It starts at the groin and goes down to the ankle. I don’t see anything that would be pause for concern with Angelina.” Well, that’s definitely good news! See some photos of Angelina’s thin frame here.

Dr. Lee also shared what kind of veins would be dangerous. “If her veins were spider-like or if they were bigger bulging veins, then she would need to have those treated, but we typically only see that in larger people and older individuals,” she continued. “For what she is showing, it’s not symptomatic. She’s just a vascular woman.”

Angelina and her fit body recently made headlines when she graced the Nov. 2017 cover of Bazaar. The mother of six has been keeping busy since her split from Brad Pitt, 53, and keeps proving she’s dedicated to raising her children and staying active in her charitable contributions.

Jennifer Garner can let those pesky pregnancy rumors go, but when it comes to misleading news stories about her divorce, she’s not here for it.

The typically private actress took to her Facebook page Wednesday afternoon to “set the record straight” on a cover story People magazine ran in its new issue. The article, titled “Life After Heartbreak,” seemingly presents itself as an interview with Garner, but instead references insiders and sources who claim her split with Ben Affleck has “been the most difficult decision for her.”

Another insists Garner will “eventually” start dating again. “She’s certainly not jumping up and down and screaming, ‘I’m single!’ and planning dates,” the source says. “She still says Ben was the love of her life.”

Garner was quick to respond to the story, writing in a statement, “I did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article.”

Following their most recent breakup, Bieber, 24, was spotted crying his eyes out in L.A. and was said to be “devastated” that the “love of his life” wasn’t ready to commit, an insider previously told RadarOnline.com .

However, that didn’t last long! This week, the “Sorry” singer was spotted out numerous times with hot blonde model, Baskin Champion! But according to a source close to Gomez, “Selena is telling her friends that she doesn’t give a f**k what Justin is up to and the fact that he is seeing other women is the exact reason why she ended this last time.”

Although Gomez is said to care less about what her ex is doing, recent photos suggest otherwise ! “Selena has been very distant from everyone and there is a lot of concern for her well-being because she’s been acting off,” the insider said.

“Her mother Mandy was hoping that her breakup with Justin would bring Selena back into her life and that has not happened,” the source told RadarOnline.com . “Mandy has literally tried everything she can and Selena just does not seem interested in working things out at all.”

“Selena’s friends think that the only reason she got back with Justin in the first place was to break his heart for breaking her heart so many times,” the insider added.

Fake rumours emerged this week that the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, had died following an influx of Twitter users falsely speculating he had passed away.

According to The Sun, the Queen was furious with the rumours, and even called her 97-year-old husband to discuss how they could stop it happening in future.

A source told The Sun: ""They both agreed there was little they could do but they are very, very annoyed.

“The Queen is absolutely fuming over this and thinks it’s disgraceful.”

The Queen, 92, is currently on holiday at Craigowen Lodge in Balmoral while the Duke stays at Sandringham.

-9017740875,Lena Dunham: Losing Birth Control Could Mean a Life of Pain - The New York Times,"I was 12 the first time I felt the crippling cramps. I hadn’t yet gotten my period and was happily running around a state fair with my best friend, mouth full of cotton candy, when it hit me: a steady drum of pain beneath my pubic bone, a throbbing in my back that made its way down both my legs. I fell to the muddy ground. Suddenly the Ferris wheel was a nightmare, the carnival games distorted and unpleasant. I blacked out.

At the E.R. they told me it could’ve been a reaction to bad chicken (sure) and sent me home with Pepto-Bismol. Thus began a 15-year routine of pain, questions and nonanswers that would continue until I was found to have endometriosis at age 27. (This delay is not unusual, and the average woman suffers for years before she is given a diagnosis.) My only savior during much of that time? Oral contraception.

Image Lena Dunham in New York City earlier this year. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times

Birth control pills are many women’s method of choice for preventing unintended pregnancy and should be covered by all insurance policies for that reason alone. But for millions of women living with endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, cystic acne, migraines, uterine abnormalities and a history of ectopic pregnancies, birth control can be a crucial, even lifesaving, medical treatment. While there is no cure for endometriosis, hormonal contraception can control pain and bleeding by stopping or significantly shortening the length of a woman’s period. It helps keep women with the disease happy, healthy and able to work. Considering how little money the government puts into endometriosis research (last year, the National Institutes of Health allocated around $10 million of its $32 billion budget to it), it’s clear that our country already has a dangerous disregard for women with this common condition. But imagine if this disease that affects about one in 10 women of reproductive age were allowed to progress unhindered. Imagine losing these women’s essential contributions to our world because of a treatable illness.",fake

OK so technically,doesn’t owe Selena Gomez anything when her birthday comes around this July 22. The singer will be turning 26, and there’s one thing she really wants from her ex — but it’s not exactly a gift. Well, not a physical one, anyway. “The one thing Selena hopes Justin will give her for her birthday this weekend is peace and quiet. She is finally in a good place, having really moved on from their relationship, so Selena kinda hopes Justin does not stir anything up with her by sending her a gift, flowers, or even trying to reach out with a phone call or text,” a source close to Selena tells

Considering Justin’s now engaged to another woman, we don’t think Selena will have to worry about Justin sending her anything in the mail. But irregardless, “Selena totally respects Justin and his relationship with his new fiancee, Hailey [Baldwin], so she feels it would be awkward and maybe even disrespectful to Hailey for Justin to wish Selena a happy birthday. So the only thing Selena really wants from Justin for her birthday this year, is for him to be happy and not reach out in anyway,” our source adds.

For the sake of everyone in this longstanding love triangle, we hope Justin respects Selena’s wishes and hold back from sending her anything on her birthday. Not only would be it disrespectful to Hailey, but it would just play with Selena’s emotions.

Anyway, we’re super excited for Selena’s birthday and can’t wait to see how she celebrates her big day! Who knows — maybe she’ll link up with BFF Taylor Swift and they’ll have some fun together. That would be awesome. Or maybe Selena will finally meet her future “perfect boyfriend”.",fake

What is Eric Johnson's Net Worth?

Eric Johnson is an American football player who has a net worth of $10 million. Though it should be noted that the majority of Eric's net worth is attributable to his wife Jessica Simpson, whom he marred in 2014. Born Eric Maxwell Johnson on September 15, 1979, in Needham, Massachusetts, US, he played as a tight end in the National Football League. Athletically gifted Johnson first got the chance to flaunt his football skills on a wider scale at Yale, where he played as a wide receiver. He was the one to catch 21 receptions for 244 yards in Yale's come-from-behind victory against Harvard in 1999, including the game-winning touchdown catch. He turned pro after he was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round of the 2001 NFL Draft.

When healthy, he was a big contributor to the 49ers passing game. But still, he did miss all of the 2003 and 2005seasons, due to injuries. He remained with the San Francisco 49ers until 2006, and he signed a one-year contract with the New Orleans Saints in 2007. The following year he got re-signed by the team, but the Saints released him for good on July 31, 2008. Two years after his retirement from the sport, the once-married former NFL player started dating singer Jessica Simpson. The couple announced their engagement few months later and they have now three children together.",fake

Unfortunately, after years of serving as Hollywood’s golden couple, Brangelina’s reign has come to an end. With so much attention being paid to Angie’s most recent beau, why not reflect on some of her past relationships? Some of which are likely to surprise you!

Jonny Lee Miller

Prior to Pitt, Angelina had actually been married twice. The first was to fellow actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met on the set of the 1996 film Hackers. The loved-up pair got hitched six months after shooting ended and ultimately divorced three years later, though they remain friends to this day.

Billy Bob Thornton

Those who recall it may associate Angelina and Billy Bob Thornton’s relationship with her darker, wild-child days. The eccentric couple got married in Vegas after two months of courtship, during which they became famous for their frequent PDA, 20-year age difference, and wearing vials of each other’s blood. Their marriage came to an end in 2003.

The press was quick to point out that Kilmer, age 44 to her 29, was the second in a series of significantly older boyfriends in Angie’s life. Ultimately, the fling was kept private and brief.

However, their short 2003 fling was kept so quiet that only a few sightings of them being romantic at parties were ever reported in the media.

Jenny Shimizu

In April, there was chatter that Pitt and Oxman were a thing after the actor was seen a few times on the MIT campus. The pair do share some of the same interests — she’s an architect/designer who teaches at the MIT Media Lab and he has a home-building organization that’s partnered with MIT folks in the past — and both are impossibly good looking.

At the time, their relationship was “best described as a professional friendship. . . . Their friendship has not turned into romance . . . as both are cautious,” an unnamed source told the New York Post.

Just two weeks ago, Radar reported that Pitt, who’s separated from wife Angelina Jolie, is “absolutely in love” with Oxman and preparing to introduce her to his children.

Now, though, Oxman seems to be on Team Ackman. The Post reports that Oxman and Ackman, who got divorced last year, were “openly affectionate” during the tennis tournament and later attended a party together.

The news was quickly picked up by national outlets such as People.

The Blast reported that both parties recently filed court documents to extend a ""temporary judge"" oversight period on their divorce case, allowing it to remain private while Pitt and Jolie continue to discuss dividing up assets and custody of their six children.

Currently, the blog reported, Jolie has custody of Maddox, Zahara, Pax, Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne. Pitt has visitation rights.

The blog cited anonymous sources who portrayed ongoing talks between Pitt and Jolie as ""very amicable.""

""Brangelina,"" as the couple is frequently named in celebrity media, got engaged in 2012, stating they did not plan to marry until same-sex marriage was legal across the United States.

In August 2014, 10 months before same-sex marriages were legal, they married in a surprise ceremony in France, where Jolie has family.

Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016, citing irreconcilable differences.

It was a culture of silencing and that was normalized,” Laura Dern shared of women, at the 2018 Golden Globes, adding that we should all aim to instill confidence in younger generations. “I urge all of us to not only support survivors and bystanders who are brave enough to tell their truth, but to promote restorative justice. May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture’s new north star.”

Hollywood stars have certainly continued to take note of the positive changes, and have taken to their respective social media accounts to pay tribute to the progress made on International Women’s Day.

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.

Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""

He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""

But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""

Williams later responded on Twitter:, external ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.

""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""",fake

The source also added that the couple might try the IVF method. While Brad Pitt has six children with Angeline Jolie, this will be Jennifer’s first child.

-8887202012,Billy Bush Confirms It Was Trump on 'Access Hollywood' Tape,"Former NBC host Billy Bush has lashed out at President Donald Trump for trying to cast doubt on the authenticity of the now infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, which captured Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women.

“Of course he said it,” Bush wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday titled, “Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That”.

Bush said he felt compelled to speak out after the president reportedly began telling aides and fellow politicians that the tape was fabricated.

“President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history,” Bush said.

“This has hit a raw nerve in me.”

In the 2005 recording, which resurfaced during the final moments of last year’s presidential campaign when it was published by the Washington Post, Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent.

Trump, on a hot mic, tells the Access Hollywood anchor about unsuccessfully trying to have sex with a married woman and how “you can do anything” to women “when you’re a star.” He said he was able to “grab them by the pussy.”

After the recording’s release, Trump, then a presidential candidate, issued an apology and dismissed the talk as “locker room” banter.

More recently, Trump has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually his, according to the New York Times.

Bush, who was fired by NBC after the tape’s release, confirms the voice is undoubtedly Trump’s, but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than “hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator”.

“There were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act,” Bush wrote.

His perspective changed when he read an account of 20 women who accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior.

One woman’s story, about being pushed against a wall and groped, made “the whole ‘better use some Tic Tacs’ and ‘just start kissing them’ routine real,” Bush said. “I believe her”.",fake

On Wednesday afternoon, the reality TV star confirmed in a statement obtained by ABC News that she was a part of the incident, which prompted Warner Brothers, the studio behind the show, to suspend production and to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct.

Though she did not go into detail, Olympios explained that she is currently in therapy to ""begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma"" that she sustained while shooting the show in Mexico.

She also said that she has retained an attorney to ""obtain justice.""

“I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4. Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place,"" she said, adding, ""As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality.""

A representative for Warner Brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for ABC, the network on which the show airs, referred a request for comment to Warner Brothers, since the incident deals with production.

On Sunday afternoon, Warner Brothers released a statement confirming that production on season four of the show had been suspended and ""appropriate responsive action"" would be taken following a ""thorough investigation.""

Two days later, Chris Harrison, the host of the Bachelor franchise, urged fans to ""be patient"" and apologized for ""any inconvenience and disappointment"" caused by the show's suspension.

Last week, ABC released the names of several Bachelor in Paradise contestants. In addition to Olympios, they included Raven Gates, Alexis Waters, Jasmine Goode and DeMario Jackson.

Kim looking trim – and Star suggests there’s a horrifying reason why! (Credit: Getty images)

According to an outrageous report in US tabloid Star today, Kim is allegedly the subject of rumours that she’s had ribs surgically removed in order to achieve an hourglass figure.

‘There’s no end to Kim’s quest for perfection, but even her family is telling her this is madness,’ an insider allegedly told Star of family reaction to the ridiculous procedure.

‘Kim clearly enjoys the results – the procedure has given her the whittled middle she has always wanted – and considers it well worth the time and money spent.’

Rib removal – sometimes whispered about in celeb circles but never yet proven to actually occur – is seen by mainstream medicine as a dangerous and unethical procedure, as in theory it could potentially result in deadly injuries to internal organs in the case of an accident.

‘No reputable doctor would remove body parts that have a critical purpose,’ says plastic surgeon Dr Matthew Shulman. ‘Ribs are there to protect your organs.’

They’ve always had chemistry, but the timing has never been right — until now.”

As fans know, Rob went through a very public breakup with girlfriend of five years Kristen Stewart in 2013, and broke off his engagement to singer FKA twigs just last year, so we can understand why he’d want to avoid getting into another serious relationship. Sorry, Katy!

On June 14, the Duchess of Sussex accompanied Prince Harry’s grandmother on an overnight train ride to attend royal engagements in Cheshire, England, and the pair couldn’t have look chummier.

The 92-year-old royal is reportedly smitten with the 36-year-old former actress, which has caused Kate Middleton to stir with jealousy, In Touch claims.

A source explosively told the publication, ‘Kate feels left out.’

‘Kate has spent years working on her image as ‘the perfect royal’, and Meghan is stealing her thunder,’ the source added.

Now, In Touch reveals a war is brewing between the duchesses.

‘They’re barely on speaking terms,’ the source says. ‘The popularity contestant has caused a lot of friction at the palace.’

According to the US publication’s bombshell claims, Kate feels ‘betrayed’ by the woman she had become close friends with – especially because it was Kate who helped Meghan ease into royal life before her wedding to Prince Harry.

‘Meghan has learned everything from Kate. But since the wedding, Kate feels like Meghan has barely made any effort with her and is more interested in impressing the queen,’ a palace insider tells.

Adding, ‘In all fairness, Meghan has been busy. But Kate feels like she’s put a lot of effort into their friendship and hasn’t gotten much in return.’

Back before she was a polished princess, Kate had to figure everything out on her own.

It took five years of dating Prince William for Kate to meet Her Majesty, and it took another three before the palace started giving the Duchess of Cambridge etiquette lessons.

The boiling tension have reportedly gotten so bad, In Touch claims the two princes have been forced to intervene.

‘William and Harry feel stuck in the middle,’ a source tells. ‘William is doing his best to smooth things over.’

‘The competition is out of control,’ adds the source. ‘Things are likely to go from bad to worse.’

Hmm. Are these two well known Kardashian ex’s bonding now that they are single? New pictures show that Tyga and Scott Disick partied the night away together and seemed closer than ever while doing so.

Tyga, 27, and Scott Disick, 33, have more than one thing in common, but most recently is their splits from Kardashian women. Instead of sitting at home wallowing, Tyga and Scott, who are rumored to have their own reality series in the works, spent an entire night out in West Hollywood, California on Tuesday, April 25.

The newly single former Kardashian men hit up the TAG Heuer along with the brand ambassador, Alec Monopoly. Tyga and Scott didn’t seem to have a care in the world, especially Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, who were definitely not at the event. In fact, Kourtney was too busy having her own party in Mexico with all of her closest friends to celebrate her 38th birthday — without Scott!

Despite the fact that both Tyga and Scott are single now, one of their rumored flings just so happened to be at the TAG Heuer party, too. It was Ella Ross, the stylist/model who Scott is rumored to be seeing now that he’s done with Kourtney. Although Scott and Ella weren’t pictured together during the party, photos on the Daily Mail show her leaving with a friend in the backseat of a super fancy luxury vehicle. Possibly set up by Scott? Hmm!

As for Tyga’s ex, Kylie, she’s busy doing her own bonding with rumored new boyfriend, Travis Scott. As HollywodLife.com has previously reported, Travis has proved to be a “better fit” for Kylie than Tyga, which means their tumultuous back-and-forth romance might finally be done for good.

But Aniston doesn’t want to keep all this fine and okay and great energy to herself, she wants to share it with others who may tragically be less fine. How? As she told Amy Sedaris in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar:

My dream is to open a wellness center. I have a fantasy where you have this beautiful space with facialists, rotating workouts, meditation classes, and a café with recipes that are healthier versions of delicious foods so you’re not deprived. I’m working on it in my brain. Not to sound all woo-woo, but if you go out into the world with inner peace, you’re more joyful. There’s a life’s-too-short policy that I now have with my work; no negative Nancies.

All of that sounds (much like Aniston herself) okay and great, but the Aveeno spokesperson also shared some of the potential risks associated with attaining inner peace through facials:

I had a facial and woke up later with what looked like cystic teenage acne. It was an intense thing to look at Justin’s face. He was like, “What is happening?”

“They are not married,” the rep confirmed to Us of the 53-year-old Gravity star and her photographer beau. The couple, who have been dating for over two and a half years, have not yet tied the knot.

Back in November, a pal of Bullock’s talked to Us about her relationship with the Los Angeles-based photog and described him as “one of the nicest guys ever.” The friend added: “Bryan has fully stepped up and embraced the dad role. He is 100 percent there for Louis and Laila and wonderful with them in every way. Sandy feels incredibly fortunate and blessed that she is sharing the parenting journey with Bryan.”

The couple’s relationship comes after Bullock’s turbulent marriage to West Coast Choppers owner Jesse James. The two divorced in 2010 after James admitted to cheating on her with multiple women throughout their five-year union.

The Proposal star opened up to Vogue in October 2013 about her divorce: “We’re all where we’re supposed to be,” she told the mag at the time. “I am exactly where I want to be now. You can’t go backward. I’m not going backward. I’m grateful that I’m here, blessed to have what I have. Nobody can be prepared for anything.”

-8718538426,Helping a person with an impairment or disability,"Help for someone with an impairment or disability

There's a range of options to help someone

Everyone needs help sometimes. Some people, including people with disabilities or impairments, may need more help than others. Sometimes a person has trouble

Providing for their personal needs

Managing their money

Making important decisions by themselves

There are many ways that a person, or others who love and support the person, can get the help they need. Most of them don’t require asking a court to appoint another person to act or make decisions for the person who needs help (called a conservatorship).

Definitions you need to know to understand options

These terms can help you understand the type of help that may be best for the person's needs.

Function: a specific act or activity that a person does or cannot do.

Impairment: a loss of function; any disorder or condition affecting one or more mind or body systems.

Disability: a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one more major life activities.

A person can have an impairment without having a disability. A person with a disability can have a wide range of impairments going from minor impairments to more severe ones. Additionally, a person with an impairment or disability will have some functions that they can perform and some they cannot. This is important when considering what type of help is appropriate. Because of the range of needs, there are as many ways to help as there are people that need that help.

You must explore all the options to help before going to court

Although this Guide deals with conservatorships primarily, a judge will only grant a conservatorship if no less restrictive alternative is appropriate. It is important to remember that there may be other less restrictive options for you or your loved one that should be considered first.",fake

After a long absence from the spotlight, the “Look What You Made Me Do” singer, 27, is set to release her brand new album Reputation in November. The release marks the end of Tay’s seclusion from the public eye. For months, Taylor has kept a low profile, which enabled her to maintain a relationship with British actor Joe, 26.

While the insider says Joe has promised Tay “he’s in it for the long haul,” Taylor has her doubts. “Privately she knows he’s never experienced this level of fame and hysteria,” the insider explained.

""The claims are greatly exaggerated or fabricated,"" the source said. ""But he’ll always do whatever is best for his kids. Despite being on the receiving end of an onslaught of allegations, he remains focused on doing whatever is best for the children.”

TMZ reports the actor, whose wife Angelina Jolie filed for divorce Monday, is under investigation following an incident on a private jet.

Child abuse claims help poison Brangelina divorce

TMZ says the case was referred over to the FBI on Thursday due to the fact that the alleged incident happened in the air while the family was on a plane from France last Wednesday.

“The FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,” FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY.

Brangelina split, Day 2: What we know now

In divorce documents, Jolie listed the couple's date of separation as the following day, Sept. 15.

People.com reports that Pitt is accused of getting verbally abusive with one of couple's kids, as well as getting physical while the family was on their private plane. People and TMZ both note that Jolie and at least some of the couple's other children were present at the time.

All told, they gave more than $8 million in donations in 2006, with Pitt putting in $4,402,317, and Jolie donating $4,123,613, the Huffington Post reports, citing newly released federal tax filings. (These latest figures don’t include 2007 – in which, among other charitable efforts, Brad’s Make It Right Foundation raised $5 million.)

In terms of dispensing their funds, according to records for 2006, the foundation handed out $2,367,935, including $1 million to both Doctors Without Borders (International Division) and to the Global Action for Children.

Additional gifts included $137,935 to the Namibia Red Cross Action Program (their daughter Shiloh was born in the African country); $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation (the late journalist’s widow, Marianne Pearl, was played by Jolie in A Mighty Heart); $100,000 to Global Green U.S.A. and to the Epidermolysis Bulloma Medical Research Foundation.

In addition, $20,000 went to an art park in Los Angeles, as did separate $5,000 donations to two orphanages that Jolie had visited.

-8664993362,"What, Exactly, Is Katie Holmes’s Relationship to Tabloids?","It’s been more than a decade since Tom Cruise publicly declared his love for Katie Holmes in an enthusiastic reveal on The Oprah Winfrey Show. In perhaps an even more surprising passage of time, it’s been nearly five years since Cruise and Holmes announced their split in June 2012 when their daughter, Suri, was just six years old. The divorce was surrounded by rumors and reports, namely involving Cruise’s involvement in Scientology. In a new interview with Town & Country, Holmes made a vague reference to how the rumor mill still affects her and her daughter’s lives—or doesn’t.

“In today’s world a lot of celebrities probably shield their children from the tabloids; in my household we know what they print isn‘t true, so we don’t pay attention,” she said.

This quote begs the question of just how much Holmes, who has primary custody of her daughter, lets Suri see or read when it comes to tabloid mentions (especially involving the two of them).

In a clear effort for privacy, the actress and director has been careful to keep her only child out of the public eye. Suri makes rare appearances on Holmes’s social-media accounts, mostly for occasions like a family birthday party last September and her mother’s birthday in December.

In her Town & Country interview, Holmes said she knows she cannot control the fact that her name will be tabloid fodder.

“There are more important things,” she continued. “But it’s very relatable to me; if people know who you are, they might write about you, and you can't control that.”

Throughout the piece Holmes remained coy about just how private she keeps her daughter‘s life. But she was direct about one thing in particular: her main focus is for Suri, who will be 11 in April, to maintain her childlike innocence as long as possible.

“My child is the most important person to me, and her upbringing is paramount to my work right now,” she said. “It’s very important that I’m present and she has a stable, innocent childhood. I feel so blessed to do what I do, but there's nothing in the world better than watching your child succeed.”",fake

Four years later, Holmes and Foxx have finally taken their romance out into the open, but the Mission: Impossible star has aware that they were a couple for some time and isn’t thrilled that his friend would date his former wife.

The first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He’s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it’s all said and done. On Liam’s first single, “Strip That Down,” he’s dissed One Direction plain as day. “You know I used to be in 1D, now I’m out free,” he sings. “People want me for one thing, that’s not me. I’m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.”



But with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan’s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. “I’ll be honest with you, it’s not my sort of music. It’s not something I’d listen to,” he said. But he did have a quick save: “I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That’s the way I’d put it best, I think.” Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn’t listen to hip-hop. “My song’s more ‘Rack City’ and his song is more of a different era to something I’d listen to, I guess,” he said. “Strip That Down” does feature a rapper, Migos’s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.

And in all seriousness: I hope Lively and Reynolds never, ever split up. After Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's breakup announcement earlier this week, half of Twitter is turning to Blake and Ryan for comfort. The people need a hot celebrity couple to live vicariously through, and Lively and Reynolds can't let them down now.

The reality star responded to a fan Friday who pointed out the buzz circulating that she was going to give her baby the floral-inspired name.

“Rose is so cute but no that’s not on my list,” Kardashian replied on Twitter.

The rumors likely came out of the fact that Kardashian, 33, frequently posts photos of luxurious rose arrangements to her social media — usually in shades of pink and white.

She’s still technically married to Brad Pitt, 52, but Angelina Jolie, 41, allegedly has her heart set on a new marriage. Barely a year after filing for divorce from her husband, Angelina is reportedly planning her fourth wedding to a wealthy, 40-something businessman and philanthropist, according to InTouch Weekly! Angelina and her handsome British guy reportedly started dating in early 2017, and has been keeping the whole relationship “very hush-hush.” That means that Brad has no idea she’s dating, let alone engaged or getting married. Uh oh!

“Angelina could tell Brad what’s going on but she’s choosing not to,” a source told InTouch. She reportedly hopes he “will be taken by complete surprise. If it makes Brad unhappy when he finds out, she’s fine with that.” She actually hasn’t even told her six kids about the alleged wedding for fear that they’ll spill the beans to their dad. Crafty!

As for the wedding itself, Angelina’s reportedly taking her closest friends and family to Cambodia, “her second home,” for a traditional Buddhist ceremony, according to the source. The wedding will allegedly take place on a wildlife reserve, wear traditional Cambodian clothing, and serve local delicacies at the reception. “Angie’s thinking of having Shiloh, Zahara, and Vivienne as bridesmaids and Maddox as the groom’s best man since Maddox sort of feels he’s the man of the family now,” the source said. Knox will allegedly be the ring bearer, and Pax will DJ and bake the cake for the reception (he did for his parents’ wedding, too!) It all sounds lovely, but how will Brad react when he finds out?

Jennifer Garner is settling into her new life as a single mom.

The actress, who filed for divorce from Ben Affleck on April 13, is “doing okay,” an insider tells PEOPLE in this week’s cover story. “This has really been the most difficult decision for her. But it’s time to focus on the future.”

Garner, 45, and Affleck, 44, who each asked for joint custody of their three kids, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5, continue to effectively co-parent together, according to sources.

While Affleck lived in the guest house on the couple’s L.A. property since he and Garner announced their split in June 2015 after 10 years of marriage, the actor has now moved to a nearby home to remain close to his family.

“They want to be sure the kids are comfortable,” says a source close to both. “It’s all in step with what they’ve always said was the most important thing: their children.”

Although the report claimed Stewart had been caught visiting Cargile’s home on June, Gossip Cop has confirmed the cheating allegations as false. The outlet also noted that while Stewart has been known to return to Cargile when other romances have failed, she and Maxwell are currently going strong and have a solid relationship.

However, the concerns quickly melted after Prince Harry and Markle gave their first interview together. It was evident that the two shared a strong connection, despite only having been dating for 16 months.

But now, it would appear that their mutual love for one another isn’t the only thing they share in common. In an unlikely reveal, it would appear that the ginger prince and the Suits actress also have a shared interest in stripping.

According to TMZ, who have access to a copy of Markle’s old resumé, the future duchess listed some rather unconventional talents and skills. The brunette beauty, who once posed as a briefcase girl on Deal or No Deal, claimed to be good at many sports, including basketball, golf, swimming, horse riding, snowboarding and baton twirling.

The report claims that Prince Harry and Markle's marriage has ""hit the rocks following a blistering fight."" A so-called insider claimed that ""Harry and Meghan hadn't even had time to unpack from their honeymoon when tempers flared.""

The blame was put on Markle who reportedly wanted to shirk her royal responsibilities because she was supposedly pregnant. The tabloid added that her ""excitement turned to horror when she learned they could be at risk for contracting"" the Zika virus which is dangerous for expectant moms.

""I'm told Meghan turned to Harry and announced, 'Of course, if the threat of Zika is still there in October, we will cancel the trip',"" the insider added.

The Duke reportedly blew up and yelled at his wife telling Markle that they will not cancel the trip no matter what. ""You're a member of the royal family now — if we commit to something, we do it!"" Prince Harry said.

According to Gossip Cop, however, the report is not reliable. The so-called insider constantly uses the words ""I'm told"" and ""I'm hearing"" which are telltale signs that the claims are illegitimate. In addition, no reputable publication picked up the same report that Markle is pregnant.

On the contrary, a source told Us Weekly that Prince Harry and Markle are not in a rush to have a baby since they have a lot of things on their plate.

""Harry and Meghan won't rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They'll make fantastic parents,"" the insider said.

The couple is already parents to North, 4, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 3 months, but a source told Radar Online they are itching for baby No. 4 by the end of this year.

“It’s always been a question of when, not if they’ll add to the family,” the source explained. “They’re confident they can cope with this because of the support they have with childcare.” And, yes, Kim will likely go the surrogate route again as the publication reported that she will probably use the same woman who carried Chicago.

Although Kim and Kanye are ready for a fourth child — hopefully another son if Kanye had it his way — some close friends don’t think it’s such a good idea. Radar Online reported that this could be something that actually tears them apart since their relationship isn’t in the greatest place at the moment.

“A lot of people think it’s crazy, since their marriage is hardly in the ideal place and they’re already struggling to cope with the demands of three kids,” the source said. “But they’re ignoring all reason and going with their impulse here.”

While Kim and Kanye have yet to comment on the possibility of adding to their family so soon, the KKW Beauty star did tell Elle‘s April issue that a fourth baby would be her last. “I don’t think I could handle more than [four kids]. My time is spread really thin,” Kim explained. “And I think it’s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.”

Kim and Kanye started dating in April 2012 before tying the knot in 2014 and they are still the perfect match for each other. “He’s taught me to have more of an opinion,” Kim admitted. “I’ve taught him to be a bit more calm or cautious. We’re a good balance.”",fake

However, their personal and professional lives constantly create sensational headlines. Most recently, it was absurdly claimed that Jennifer and her ex-husband Brad could have a sensational reunion on the sets of a new rom-com movie.

The latest report from Heat Magazine asserted that the newly single Jennifer and Brad are said to be ""seriously considering"" featuring in a feature film together for the first time. Prior to this, they shared screen space in FRIENDS TV series when Brad made a memorable cameo.

An alleged source told the magazine that since Brad and Jennifer both are friends again, it would be a tremendous opportunity to make a feature-length film. However, the new characters will not be seen as ardent lovers, but they would typically have to interact in front of the camera.

""It's not like they would be playing lovers or anything, but the project is in the romantic comedy genre and their characters would cross paths. The movie producers are really excited and feel this would be dynamite casting,"" added the insider.

Jennifer and Brad married in 2000 but split after five years. The latter decided to start a new life with Angelina Jolie, whereas Jennifer decided to focus on different movie projects. Back in 2011, Jennifer started seeing Justin Theroux and got married in August 2015. But the couple announced they were ""lovingly"" parting their ways after just two years of marriage.

Ever since Aniston and Theroux ended their marriage, many speculated that Brad Pitt and Jennifer will soon reconcile their previous differences. However, this is not the case. Gossip Cop repeatedly confirmed that Brad and Jennifer have not in touch with each other ever since their divorce.

Gossip Cop also debunked the claims made by the Heat Magazine that Jen and Brad are reuniting for a romantic comedy-drama. Apparently, this is not the first time when the reports surfaced that pointed towards a possible feature film starring Aniston and Pitt.

-8418748457,Amal Clooney Body-Shamed Two Months After Giving Birth To Twins,"“Oddly, Amal looked slim and frail in her sporty ensemble. No remaining baby weight was apparent in her now stick-thin frame,” the outlet continues, noting, “George too seemed off, as he flashed a shocked, cold look at the cameras while walking with his wife. The duo seemed to want to avoid attention as they left the court.”

You think? Like most famous couples, the Clooneys don’t like being followed by paparazzi. It’s no wonder George appeared unhappy. As for his wife, there was nothing “odd” about her appearance, despite the online publication using that description twice. While this story is written as if Clooney only gave birth just a few “weeks” ago, the twins actually arrived on June 6, nearly 12 weeks ago. That’s more than just a few. And at nearly three months post-partum, it is not unreasonable that the attorney is back to her normally slim frame.

She by no means look “skeletal,” and there is nothing “shocking” about the photos. RadarOnline shamefully wanted a clickbait approach to the latest snapshots of the couple, and grossly decided Clooney’s body should be the angle. The webloid even asks readers at the end, “What do you think of Amal’s extreme weight loss? Do you think the pair is doing okay after welcoming their twins?” Here’s another question: Why would random people on the Internet know whether the Clooneys are doing okay?

For the record, they are. But at issue is the site’s fake concern. The outlet didn’t post these photos because they were genuinely worried Clooney was on an “extreme post-baby weight loss diet.” They wanted traffic. And if the lawyer was still on the heavier side, the publication would’ve claimed she was struggling to lose weight. There’s no way to win. This is the same webloid that body-shamed Tori Spelling for gaining weight after body-shaming her for being too skinny. RadarOnline remains disgusting.

The songstress and husband Jay Z have kept a lid on the details about the new additions to their family, but sources close to the couple have confirmed the happy news to various media outlets. One insider told People: “Bey and Jay are thrilled and have started sharing the news with their family and closest friends.” While Beyoncé had previously revealed she was expecting twins, as of right now the babies’ sex and names are still unknown.

Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian has already been accused of trying to steal Beyoncé’s thunder. The accusations started to fly when Kim purchased a Pomeranian puppy for her daughter North West – and broke the news just as Beyoncé is thought to have given birth. While the timing was somewhat suspicious, Kim took it one step further by asking fans for help in naming the dog. She tweeted: “So North wants to name her puppy Mercy, thoughts? We need a good name!” This, of course, briefly diverted some of the attention away from new mum Beyoncé.

Kim and Beyoncé have both run in the same celebrity circles for many years thanks to the friendship between their husbands Kanye West and Jay Z. That said, there have been countless reports about their allegedly frosty relationship. In fact, just last year it was claimed that Bey has “never liked genuinely liked Kim”. A source told Mail Online:

She’s mostly tolerated her because of their husbands’ friendship and [their] mutual friends, like Jennifer Lopez. She is always a little icy to Kim. The last time they hung out, the minute Beyoncé could leave the conversation, she did. They always have lots of awkward pauses.

Moving forward…

It’s unlikely that Kim will ever admit that she set out to outshine her ‘rival’ – nor is it likely that Beyoncé will even be miffed about the poorly timed tweet at this stage. Instead, the pop star will no doubt be devoting all her energy into adjusting to life as a mum-of-three. However, it’s always possible that the feud between Kim and Bey could flare up again sometime in the near future.

“Deputies were there [and] called to the scene. They decided the child was okay and they left,” a Malibu Lost Hill’s Sheriff’s Station spokesperson told People.

Entertainment Tonight also spoke to Janet’s brother Randy Jackson who revealed the pop star decided to call 9-1-1 after the nanny (who was helping Wissam babysit) called her worried about Wissam’s aggressive behavior. “[She was] terrified by his behavior and locked herself in a bathroom, so she could contact Janet,” he told the news outlet.

Janet and Wissam previously married in 2012 and split in April 2017, just three months after Eissa was born in January 2017. “I just want to keep it real for you guys for a second — yes I separated from my husband. We are in court and the rest is in God’s hands,” Janet told her concerned fans at the time. It was subsequently reported that Janet felt like a “prisoner” in her own marriage. “She thought he had become too controlling during the pregnancy and she had already allowed him to dictate her appearance and even the way she performed at concerts,” a source told Page Six.

Now, Janet is allegedly dating her ex-boyfriend Jermaine Dupri, whom she previously dated from 2002 until 2009. “Janet’s taking it slowly, but yes, she and Jermaine are dating,” an insider recently In Touch. “She’s comfortable with him.

-8380675168,Chris Martin planning to play Argentina for Global Citizen campaign,"Coldplay frontman Chris Martin is planning to perform in Argentina as he takes the Global Citizen campaign against extreme poverty to another continent, sources close to the organizers said.

The advocacy movement, which rallies support for development assistance through music and other events, holds festivals in New York’s Central Park each year when world leaders are gathering for the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and has previously expanded to Canada, Germany and India.

Sources close to the organizers told AFP that Martin, who holds the title of festival curator, is planning a concert later this year in Buenos Aires as part of Global Citizen.

Details are being worked out but the sources said that Global Citizen’s CEO, Hugh Evans, met Thursday with President Mauricio Macri in Buenos Aires.

Macri and Argentine first lady Juliana Awada took to the stage last year at the Global Citizen festival in Hamburg to join Colombian superstar Shakira.

Macri, who will host a summit in November of the Group of 20 major economies, said at the time that the festival sent a strong message of support for fighting poverty including by investing in education and women’s empowerment.

Global Citizen does not sell tickets for its festivals but instead admits fans who commit to taking actions such as writing to their governments to support development aid as part of the UN-backed goal of eradicating the planet’s most extreme poverty by 2030.

Reports earlier indicated that Global Citizen is also planning a large event in South Africa in December to mark this year’s centennial of the birth of anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela.

Coldplay both launched and ended its last world tour in Argentina. The English rockers’ tour became the third highest grossing in music history. MKH

Kanye West, 40, seems to be throwing subtle shade at Tristan Thompson, 27, just days after it was revealed that he allegedly cheated on Khloe Kardashian, 33, with a few different women over the last several months. On April 15, the rapper took to Twitter and posted a picture of himself with Khloe’s ex-husband, Lamar Odom, 38, when they walked into MSG together during the Yeezy fashion show on Feb. 11, 2016. It was Lamar’s first public appearance since his nearly fatal drug overdose in Oct. 2015. “My favorite moment of walking into MSG to play Saint Pablo, I used to go to the hospital and play Lamar the album when he was learning to walk and talk again Then we walked into the arena together,” he tweeted — one of the rapper’s first since returning to Twitter this past week.

Kanye didn’t mention Tristan nor how he allegedly cheated on Khloe, but the timing of this tweet couldn’t be more suspicious. Kanye raving over Khloe’s ex-husband just days after the world discovered Tristan had allegedly cheated on his then-pregnant girlfriend? Hmm… If you ask us, he’s definitely making it clear that he wishes Khloe had given Lamar another chance. Maybe then, she wouldn’t have had to experience the heartbreak Tristan recently put her through. Poor Khloe — our hearts ache for her and her newborn daughter.

[She] told Kendall that dating Jordan isn’t a smart move, and that she should be dating a famous rapper or musician if she wants to gain popularity.”

UPDATE: a source has told HollywoodLife.com that this is not true.

Wow! To think that having 150,000 followers on Twitter is something to be ashamed of! Kim, 35, has incredibly high standards for herself, and she wants Kendall, 20, to find a guy who’s her equal, just like she did with husband Kanye West, 38. But calling 24-year-old Jordan un-famous is pretty unfair. He’s an NBA star who plays for the Lakers, for goodness sake!

Kim should realize that the heart wants what it wants! After all, she once married a not-so famous basketball star and…okay that’s not the best example. But still! Kim shouldn’t get too concerned just yet, as Kendall and Jordan are reportedly keeping things casual at the moment.

A photographer shouted at Caitlyn Jenner 'Oi Bruce, get your d*** out' as she left the British LGBT Awards in London.

Police have launched a hate crime investigation after the incident on Friday night.

Jenner was a guest at the ceremony, where she received a Loud And Proud trophy following her transition from Bruce Jenner in 2015, which she has spoken about publicly.

As she left the event at the Grand Connaught Rooms in central London an onlooker hurled transphobic abuse at her until she got into a car.

It is also claimed that someone threw something at her while the vile comments were being made.

A source told The Sun Online: 'Caitlyn had an amazing night and when she won her award the room went crazy.

'She'd had such a wonderful time but as she went to leave the whole atmosphere changed.

'Someone shouted to her, ""Oi, Bruce, get your d*** out"". Then someone else threw something at her. It was horrible.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed that officers had been called to the address on Friday night.

He said: 'Police were called on Friday May 12 at 11.40pm to an awards event in Great Queen Street, WC2, following an allegation of a hate crime.

'Officers attended and spoke to one of the organisers who alleged that a photographer had verbally abused a woman and a man as they were leaving the event.

Since his split from Kylie Jenner in March 2017, Tyga has been spotted out and about with various different women who look like the reality star, but they’ll never hold a candle to the reality star in his mind. “Kylie fits the profile of Tyga’s ideal woman, physically — he loves brunettes with big lips, big brown eyes and a big butt,” an insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. “The thing with Kylie, though, is that it was about so much more than just what she looked like. Obviously, she was sexy and all, but Tyga had a really strong connection with her that went far deeper than the physical side of things.”

Tyga and Kylie broke up and got back together several times throughout their three-year relationship, but he probably didn’t realize that the 2017 split would mean it was really over for good. Just one month later, Kylie started dating Travis Scott, and on Feb. 1, she gave birth to his child. However, Tyga is convinced that there’s still hope for a reconciliation between himself and Kylie. “Tyga truly believes deep down in his heart that they’re not over,” our source adds. “He has faith that there’s no way it will last with Travis and that one day Kylie will come running back to him again. He’s just playing a waiting game for now.”

That’s not to say that he’s sitting around by himself during this waiting period, though. In fact, on the same day Kylie gave birth, Tyga was spotted leaving a nightclub with a brunette woman who definitely resembled his 20-year-old ex. He has to pass the time somehow…

George Clooney NOT Begging Kit Harington To Hang Out, Despite Report

[You must be registered and logged in to see this image.]

By Andrew Shuster | 2:07 pm, August 9, 2017

A new tabloid report claims George Clooney is begging Kit Harington to hang out with him but the “Game of Thrones” star keeps blowing off the actor’s requests. Gossip Cop, however, can exclusively debunk this bogus story.

According to the National Enquirer, Harington recently purchased a home near Clooney’s estate in England, and now Clooney is desperately trying to become friends with the TV star. A supposed “source” tells the magazine, “George has been pestering Kit with invites to his mansions in Berkshire and Lake Como – but he’s in for disappointment. Kit doesn’t want to be his new pal.”

The outlet’s dubious insider goes on to say Harington is trying to avoid the Hollywood scene, adding, “Kit’s mind is pretty made up. He doesn’t want to be George’s buddy, but George keeps begging him to come away on a motorbike tour. It’s getting annoying!” The seemingly phony source adds, “Kit’s home is too far to take a boat, thank goodness – or else George would probably row by.”

Of course, Clooney has a wife and newborn twins at home, so it seems very unlikely he’s looking to spend his free time with a young actor he doesn’t know. Regardless of how absurd the tabloid’s story sounds, Gossip Cop still checked in with a source close to the situation, who laughed off the report before assuring us it’s “false.” Unfortunately, the Enquirer has a habit of publishing phony reports about the movie star, so this latest piece of fiction comes as no surprise.

Gossip Cop recently called out the tabloid for making up a story about Clooney loving his wife Amal’s “pregnancy curves.” We also busted the outlet after it concocted a tall tale about Clooney’s baby boy peeing in his face during a diaper change. This latest article from the untrustworthy publication is similarly untrue.

As Life & Style previously reported, things have been deteriorating between the two performers over the last couple of months. “Gwen and Blake began to argue more.

She’s even commented on the extra curves, and posted a meme on Instagram, slamming body-shamers in an epic way. The photo was of Gucci Mane‘s fluctuating weight from 2007 until now. He’s since toned up and lost a lot of weight. “If you can’t handle me at my 2007 Gucci Mane, you don’t deserve me at my 2017 Gucci Mane,” she wrote as a caption alongside the image.

But apparently it is not just her curves that are more to handle these days. Even her feet are bigger! “Her shoes are tough to squeeze into these days, because her feet have gone up by a half size,” adds the source.

That is not stopping her from opening her wallet though. The insider tells OK!, ""Ri’s not lost her expensive taste so this is hitting her hard in the pocket as long as this new lifestyle lasts.

Naturally, Alec worked to cover up his snafu. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that … Did I say remarried? We’re remodeling. Remodeling the house on Friday,” he said.

With the secret out, Hilaria went on to give details about the sweet event.

“Basically we wanted to have a party and we wanted our friends to come,” she said. “We’re gonna do something for like five minutes, I think, and then the rest of the time we’re gonna be eating.”

Ellen had been discussing Jennifer’s popularity with the ladies back in the 90s, saying: ‘I think a lot of people had crushes on you so they were hoping you were.’



Jennifer replied: ‘They did? How do you guys ever know? What are the clues?’



‘Well they don’t make it obvious like that. That would be creepy if you were like just looking somebody up and down,’ Ellen replied.



‘I don’t know how it works,’ laughed Jen.

‘Yeah,’ Jennifer responded, keeping quiet about the news of her split.

‘This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.



‘Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.



‘Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.’

Boozed Up and 40 Pounds Overweight, Jessica Simpson Could Lose Her Kids if She Can’t Clean Up Her Act.

SONGBIRD turned fashion mogul Jessica Simpson is bursting at the seams, looking anything but pulled together lately. But it’s not her shocking 40-pound weight gain or sloppy attire that has loved ones worried. Rather, it’s her wine-swilling, bingeand-purge lifestyle that’s endangering her health and could ultimately cause her children to be taken from her.

“Poor Jess really seems to be losing it,” confides a friend. “Lately, she’s been looking trashed, slurring her words, not making sense — no wonder people think she’s drunk, on drugs or both. There’s real concern that she’s on her way to a serious health problem, possibly even an overdose, if she continues down this path.”

After a boozy coast-to-coast flight on Aug. 10, Jessica, 37, was spotted spilling out of LAX airport, barely able to walk. The bloated, double-chinned mother of two was wobbly as she made her way to a waiting car and nearly passed out as soon as she got inside.",fake

Oh man. Though he was later overshadowed by Kevin Federline and his fedora, Jason Allen Alexander had a good 55 hours of fame thanks to his two-day marriage to Britney Spears. Who can forget how the tabloids were splashed with the happy (and totes not intoxicated couple): Britney Spears in her wedding ripped-jeans-and-baseball-cap, Jason hulking over her with that unfortunate Caesar haircut and power-brows. Stunning.

So how did this happen? After a night of clubbing with her childhood friend, the pair put on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and got inspired. Dude, not even kidding.

""It was just so crazy, man,"" Alexander told Access Hollywood in the aftermath. ""We were just looking at each other and said, 'Let's do something wild, crazy. Let's go get married, just for the hell of it.'""

So they hit up Vegas' Little White Wedding Chapel to get hitched in what we can only imagine was a very romantic ceremony. The bellman walked the bride down the aisle. Someone please hand us a tissue.

Obviously, Britney and her people realized that life isn't an episode of Friends and there are serious consequences to f–king up this bad. Jive records positioned it as a joke that had gone ""too far."" Jason scoffed at this, ""I was in love with her,"" he said in 2012. ""I feel like she felt the same way."" K.

In any case, the marriage was annulled and that's the last we heard of this guy until he made headlines in 2016 for spending jail time for domestic abuse against a woman he was dating. So in the long run, we guess Britney was better off moving on to KFed.

Seacrest has denied claims that he sexually harassed his former stylist Suzie Hardy while she was employed by the E! network.

In Sex & The City, Carrie Bradshaw actually THREW UP when she saw the hideous ring Aiden Shaw bought for her. That’s not exactly the best way to start the next chapter in your life. Ergo, there’s tons of pressure on dudes to buy the right diamond, the right cut, and the right band. Oh, and the right proposal plan.

The Spectacular Now actor Miles Teller and Keleigh Sperry, comedian Patton Oswalt and Meredith Salanger (this one was a little controversial considering his wife passed away less than a year before), Star Wars actress Felicity Jones and Charles Guard, and many more. 2017 also brought two famous exes back together after YEARS of being apart, and soon, they’ll be headed down the alter. Of course we’re talking Miley Cyrus and Liam! Love is officially alive and well again now that these two are back together and head over heels. The “Malibu” singer has been mum about a wedding date, but we hope it’s in the near future!

Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.

“Teresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe’s deportation and she agreed to do it,” an insider revealed. “Half a million dollars to share the story on camera.”

And this story is believable because this isn’t Teresa’s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!

“It is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,” added the source.

Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that “records show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.”

A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.

“Teresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,” the source stated.

Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.

UPDATE – Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe’s possible deportation.

-8015619251,On Again? The History of Bella Hadid's Romance With The Weeknd,"The bond between the 28-year-old multiplatinum musician (born: Abel Tesfaye) and the 21-year-old runway fixture is the type of love you write songs about (by our unofficial count, he's penned at least one) and the sort of relationship that has a necessary stumbling block in act two before they can enjoy the expected happy ending in act three. The hurdle in this case being The Weeknd's 10-month relationship with Selena Gomez, who he courted a mere two months after announcing his split from Hadid.

But as of this week, Gomez was getting close with the Calvin Klein model's big sis Gigi Hadid at the May 7 Met Gala and, of course, the Magnum ice cream ambassador couldn't have been closer to her former flame. Which begs the necessary question: Is this roller coaster romance on the ascent once more?

Well, a loop-the-loop may be more accurate. While the source acknowledges the musician has been ""dating around"" since his October split from Gomez, ""He and Bella are always flirty and spend time together when they see each other. Especially when they are out partying.""",fake

One of its main stars, Khloe Kardashian , has issued a warning about what fans will see on the show prior to it airing, where she discussed one particular topic that occurred throughout the entire time they filmed the hit series.

Major drama has already played out between the family, even before the first episode aired. A clip that was posted from the show earlier last week found Kim and Kourtney getting into it over a photo shoot, which ended with the former saying she's ""the least exciting to look at"" about her older sister.

Even though Kourtney is reportedly not on good terms with Kim regarding the fight, the warning that Khloe issued about tonight's episode had nothing to do with that.

What she discussed on her Instagram story on Sunday had to do with her ""pregnancy lips"" that she developed when she was with child. The 34-year-old gave birth to her daughter True back in April.

""PSA I was pregnant during the entire season of KUWTK,"" Khloe revealed on her IG story. ""Some women get 'pregnancy lips'. I was one of them. So my lips look crazy and massive. Trust me I know and I HATED it!""

""A lot of wild s**t happens to your body and face while pregnant,"" she continued. ""It's out of our control. Most people don't have to film during an entire pregnancy so just watch the show and be kind about my growing body and lips.""

There’s still hope for love in this world! We were devastated when Jen Garner and Ben Affleck split in June 2015, but after months of hints that they may be working on their relationship, a new report claims that they’ve renewed their vows! We have all the details, right here.

This is going to make you feel warm and fuzzy just in time for the holidays! Ben Affleck, 44, and Jen Garner, 44, have had a rough year. From a shocking split to cheating rumors and accusations of hard-partying, these two seem to have taken hit after hit in their relationship. However, it may all be over now because they’ve re-made the ultimate commitment to stand by each others’ side through thick and thin, according to a new report.

That’s right, Star Magazine reports that Jen and Ben have recently renewed their vows as rumors swirled of a fourth child being in the works. “They wanted something quiet and intimate, with just the children present,” the source told the mag. “Jen wore a sweet, simple dress and Ben put on a pair of slacks and a nice shirt.”

It sounds like the whole event was cathartic, romantic and wonderfully personal to both of them. “Afterward, she laughed and thanked him for making an honest woman out of her,” the insider continued. “He also surprised Jen with a fabulous $2.3 million diamond ring. It’s all perfect timing, especially now that their pals think she’s expecting again.”

We’re so happy for them! The couple already has three children together: Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7, and Samuel, 4, but fans noticed that Jen seemed to be sporting a baby bump on Nov. 18, and the rumors grew from there. If the family is growing their family, we couldn’t be happier for them. We just hope Ben stays on the straight and narrow so they can all continue to be happy! Congrats, guys!

The Star magazine cover story claiming Ellen has dumped Portia, which has stunned US fans. Star magazine (US)

When the talk show queen spent a whopping US$20 million on a luxury, beach-front, mansion in the sleepy Californian town of Carpinteria, everyone assumed it was just another notch on her property belt.

However, according to reports in Star magazine, Ellen bought the pad because she was in desperate need of somewhere to escape her troubled marriage to Portia.

“Ellen bought the house right after she had a huge blowout with Portia,” a source told the publication, claiming that a recent argument at their Beverley Hills home being “their worst fight yet”.

In fact, Star predicts that their nine-year-marriage is so unstable that they could be heading for a US$400 million divorce.

According the friends of the couple, Portia is sick of playing second fiddle to Ellen’s career and is demanding more attention.

However, the argument only pushed Ellen further away and she ended up storming out and decamping to her bachelorette pad.

“Ellen couldn’t wait to move into her the new house after she closed the deal,” says the insider.

“Friends and family fear that the relationship won’t survive this”

Sources say Ellen and Portia have been living separate lives for some time – with Ellen spotted having lunch with a mystery woman back in June.

“As soon as she finished work, she turns off her phone, retreats into her own little world and doesn’t want to talk to anyone, including Portia”.

The pair, who began dating back in 2014 after meeting on the set of their film The Light Between Oceans, got married in a private ceremony at a resort in Ibiza over the weekend, according to People.

Both Alicia and Michael have also been pictured with rings on their wedding finger by the Daily Mail as they spent time with family and friends on the island, so all signs point to the notoriously private couple tying the knot.

Digital Spy has reached out to reps for the actors for comment.

Alicia and Michael have largely kept their relationship private in the years they've been together, keeping public appearances together to a minimum but acknowledging their relationship in moments like Alicia kissing Michael before accepting her Oscar for The Danish Girl in February 2016.

Speaking to EW last year about their relationship, both Alicia and Michael said that they value their privacy.

""I think we've made a clear statement that we keep certain things just between us,"" Alicia said. ""It was very easy to unite, but that's quite personal.""

Michael added: ""

I'm not going to talk about my private life with a total stranger, unless I feel like I need to. Why would I? I don't.""

The couple will be entering into married life with a lot of big films on the horizon, with Michael Fassbender currently starring in the adaptation of Jo Nesbø's bestselling thriller The Snowman and also due to reprise his role as Magneto in next year's X-Men: Dark Phoenix.

Alicia, meanwhile, is gearing up for the release of the Tomb Raider reboot, in which she takes over the role of Lara Croft from Angelina Jolie.

Along with the lovely ladies mentioned above, Lopez hubby Marc Anthony, Ryan Seacrest, Randy Jackson, Idol finalists Scotty McCreery and Lauren Alaina, past winners Kris Allen and David Cook, and former Idol executive producer and So You Think You Can Dance cocreator Nigel Lythgoe were all on hand to fete Fuller in front of the W Hollywood, across the street from the famed Pantages Theatre.

-7680466627,Was Taylor Swift Carried Out of Her Apartment in a Huge Suitcase?,"As you'd expect, people on Twitter have been rejoicing over this news. But whether or not this story is true, it does hilariously highlight how weird it is to be a celebrity. I mean, we live in a world where they sell their used tissues on eBay for $5,000. And straight-up stop government elections because of their concerts. Hell, they put leeches on their bodies — for health reasons! So it's not that surprising that your favorite stars occasionally travel in unconventional ways, like private planes, tour buses, and...getting stuffed into suitcases.

Is traveling in a suitcase strange? Sure. Unabashedly extra? Absolutely. The opening scene of a future T. Swift music video called ""My Love Is in a Suitcase?"" Probably. But it's actually not that far-fetched: After all, Adele was frequently wheeled to the stage in an equipment box on her last tour. Lady Gaga arrived to the 2011 Grammy Awards in a giant egg. Sometimes the outside world is just too hard, and the only way to escape is by hopping into a box.

Of course, it's also possible this is complete rubbish or a misprint. The caption that started the mania in the first place spells Swift's name wrong in one place — so how reliable is it, actually? (And honestly, does it really matter? We wrote about it, so the joke's on us.)

Regardless, I hope somewhere right now Swift is curled up in her carry-on and cackling.

UPDATE: According to Spin, Splash News (the photo outlet responsible for this hoopla) is retracting its report that Taylor Swift was carried out of her New York City apartment in a suitcase. “I literally just put the phone down from someone on Taylor’s camp,” a Splash representative told Spin. “We’re having to actually retract that.” The representative says the photographer who originally made the claim didn't verify it. ""The report stated it as a fact, which we actually don’t know,” the representative said. “How could we?” Womp.

The latest news is that their birth certificates show that their mother, Beyoncé, shares the same obstetrician/gynaecologist as none other than Kim Kardashian.

Yes, according to TMZ, Kim and Queen B had their babies delivered by Dr Paul Crane.

It seems that Dr Crane is familiar with the Kardashian family and their brood also delivering Kourtney Kardashian's and Scott Disick's children and Dream, daughter of Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian.

Reports say that the twins were born at 5:13 am with Rumi arriving first and Sir following soon after.

Although it's been rumoured previously that Kim and Beyoncé aren't the best of pals, perhaps that's all rubbish and Kim actually provided Bey with the recommendation.

The 'divide' between the pair is said to date back to when the Carters reportedly didn't attend Kimye's wedding and although Kim is thought to have tried to arrange playdates for Blue Ivy and North, it just hasn't happened...

As it turns out, there was quite a sentimental reason before the sartorial statement. Appearing on Ellen yesterday, Gosling confirmed that the beloved canine had recently passed away at the age of seventeen. “He was a good friend to me,” Gosling told Ellen Degeneres during the sit-down. “There was something about George where he always—I think he felt being a dog was beneath him. He would not do tricks. if you wanted him to sit down you would have to convince him that it was in his best interest.”

Fans of the actor will be familiar with just how close the pair were—George even appeared alongside Gosling during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a few years back. Gosling took Friday’s stint on Ellen to share some of his other favorite memories of the canine. “One time we were at an outdoor restaurant and he was sort of sitting on the pavement, looking forlorn down the street,” he shared. “Someone got up to go to the restroom, and I guess he’d had enough, and he got up on their seat and sat down at the table like a gentleman and looked around the table, like, ‘Yeah, that’s right.’”

In brighter Gosling news, his film Bladerunner 2049, for which he’s been on the promo circuit for over the past few weeks, opened in theaters on Friday after much anticipation to generally favorable reviews. The long overdue sequel is set to pull in $36 million in its opening weekend, and is already generating some early Academy Awards buzz—meaning that we can expect plenty more emotional talk show appearances in the coming months.

Following news that Miranda Lambert ended things with her beau Anderson East, the country music cutie found an unlikely source of support — her ex-husband, Blake Shelton. And the timing could not be better — as Blake is going through his own breakup from his now-ex, Gwen Stefani.

“Miranda reached out to Blake via text,” a source close to the former spouses tells In Touch exclusively. “Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships. They’ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so.”

It’s a future that no one could’ve imagined for the exes, who were married for five years before calling it quits in 2015. At that time, it seemed unlikely that the two would ever reconcile, but now that the time has been able to pass, the two have become each other’s closest allies — and those closest to them say even a romantic reunion isn’t totally out of the question. “They have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives,” the source adds exclusively.

It turns out the timing for their reunion could not have been more perfect. Anderson decided to call it quits with Miranda after spending nearly three years together. Elsewhere in Hollywood, Blake decided to cool things off with Gwen after growing more and more tired of her constant “drama” and their disagreements when it came to starting a family together.

And despite both women having the plug pulled on their relationships, they couldn’t be handling it more differently. While Miranda is left qusetioning what the future of her love life will look like, she refuses to dwell on the past. “Her allegiance is to her songs, the road, and her fans right now,” another insider says of Miranda. Gwen is taking the news as well as Miranda. “She continues to send [Blake] loving social media support from LA while he’s been out on the road,” another insider says of the mother-of-three. “But Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.”

“Angelina has a lot of memories which make her feel emotional and she can no longer bear the sight of the home where she raised her children,” the source explained. “In order to avoid the painful, uncomfortable situation, Angelina and Brad have compromised by setting up this meeting point near the home.” It’s really sad to hear that Angelina is having trouble coping with her former family home, but we’re glad to hear that she and Brad have figured a way around it. Hopefully, one day, Angelina will be able to return to the home in order to pick up her children or even join them for a family dinner. We’re keeping our fingers crossed!

Their friends will know literally right before it happens and no sooner, a source told Entertainment Tonight. So, Chris Hemsworth should keep a bag packed at all times, probably.

""She hasn't announced anything because she is being very secretive so only their friends will know and at the very last minute,"" the source said of Cyrus's wedding planning. ""This time they are doing everything their own way.""

Part of the reason for this is because when Cyrus and Hemsworth first got engaged in 2012, their plans to have a big wedding broke them up. ""The first time they announced their engagement in 2012, they felt such pressure to make it the most spectacular wedding in the world but that was the downfall of their relationship and lead to their break up,"" the source said. Stars: they're just like us.

Cyrus is on her own time table now, the source said, and just recently committed to the idea of a simple ""ranch wedding"" to honor her country roots.

""Miley has come up with all sorts of different wedding plans,"" the source said of Cyrus’s process. ""She is always creative and thinking of new ideas that will make her experience different.""

-7521939835,Kim Kardashian admits her selfie obsession is a bit ridiculous,"Kim Kardashian has finally explained her selfie obsession, saying everyone needs to take it a little less seriously.

Covering the new issue of Adweek, Kim says she knows her constant picture-taking is a bit ""ridiculous,"" but it's just her way of remembering all the amazing things in her life. Which is fair enough, really.

""So many people think that taking so many selfies is just ridiculous,"" she says. ""For me, what's so funny is I love taking pictures and posting them on social media for memories.

""I'm kind of letting them know, yes, it is ridiculous, but it's all fun. I can look at a photo on social media and see a picture and know exactly where I was by the outfit I had on or who I was with. I take it more as a fun, emotional scrapbook that I love to look back on.""

In fact, Kim says she took her first selfie way back in 1984 when she was just five years old and, just like the rest of us, remembers the days when you had to lug an actual camera around with you.

Bear Grylls // Digital Spy

So, why is she covering Adweek? Well, she's is actually making a pretty massive impact on the tech world. Her Kim Kardashian: Hollywood made $74 million last year and is reportedly set to bring in another $200 million this year. Not bad.

The Kardashians are currently filming the tenth series of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Kim says there's no big secret to their success - they're just ""a normal family"".

""We are a family like everyone else's that goes through so many different things and we're always there to support each other. I feel like people get that message.""

We had no clue Chris Brown, 28, was still so hung up on Rihanna, 29. But sometimes it takes a huge milestone like a potential pregnancy for feelings to resurface again. Obviously, Rihanna has not yet confirmed or denied the rumors, but fans went into a tizzy, following her sexy performance of “Wild Thoughts” with DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller during the 60th annual Grammy Awards on Jan. 28. Fans thought Rihanna was dancing more “delicately” than usual, and they accused her of looking like she had gained a bit of weight. We think Rihanna looked great, but that doesn’t mean she’s not pregnant. She very well could be, but until she confirms or denies the news, we can’t say for certain.

Either way, Chris is definitely upset. And we can’t really blame him — they have so much history together. It makes sense that he would hold out hope for some sort of reconciliation in the future. But for now, Rihanna is happily dating her billionaire beau Hassan Jameel. They were even spotted partying together after the show.

As Brad Pitt was not available for an interview about his new luxury furniture line with Frank Pollaro, the Times talked to a bunch of design experts for their thoughts instead. Their observations ranged from “swanky” to “stifled”; one critic noted, “I was surprised to discover that the bathtub was a bathtub; I thought it was an ashtray.” Here are our favorite gems (and yes, the Chanel No. 5 ad was referenced):

1. “The shiny metal surprised me specifically; the mod Trumpian swankiness, in general.”

2. “These pieces are too nice; I do not hear Mr. Pitt’s voice unleashed with full authority.”

3. “Mr. Pitt, you are a great actor. Stay that person, with all of his confidence and drive and risk-taking, when designing. These first pieces are audition monologues; you already have the part.”

4. “[A piece I would want in my home is] possibly the oval table — in the guest room of a second home, if I owned a second home.”

5. “I’m not convinced after seeing three table designs (and a bathtub that reminds me of an ashtray) that Brad Pitt should quit his day job to be in the furniture or product design game. Unless that means I can be an actor for a day and get paid $7 million to star in a Chanel No. 5 perfume ad.”",fake

“I feel so excited that I finally did it,” she said.

The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star continued, “I’ve been so scared to do it thinking it hurts so badly, and it didn’t hurt that badly. So I’m so grateful, and I’m so excited. I love you Dr. Ourian!”

“So I’m spending my Saturday with Dr. Ourian and it f—— kills but it will be worth it,” she explained at the time. “We are lasering. You guys, I never thought I could love someone and hate someone so much at the same time.”

“If anyone that’s had babies understand what it’s done to your belly button, then you really understand how much you need Dr. Ourian to tighten around your belly button so it could look back normal,” she added.

A new report claims that Kylie Jenner has been thirsty dancing for Tristan’s attention.

“She’s been texting him sexy selfies and flirting non-stop when Khloe’s back is turned,” an insider exclusively told RadarOnline.com.“Kylie gets a huge kick out of it and can’t help herself.” This isn’t the first time Jenner, 19, has gone after one of her sister’s love interests. The insider points out that in the past she’s managed to grow cozy with Kendall’s guys, Kourtney’s ex, Scott Disick, and Kim’s husband, Kanye West.

We’ve heard some pretty skanky stories about Kylie that have included some of her sister’s exes, but the new reports say that this time around Kylie’s really got it bad.

“She’s got it bad for Tristan and has even told friends that he’s way too hot for Khloe,” said the insider. “If he made a move on her she’d totally go there,” warned the source, adding the situation could become explosive quite quickly, especially since Kardashian, 32, and Thompson’s relationship has hit some major speed bumps.

To make matters even worse, Tristan’s not exactly known for being Mr. Fidelity

“Tristan dumped his pregnant girlfriend for Khloe, so it’s certainly in his nature to cheat.”

Anthony Scaramucci, 53, might have found love despite losing his wife and job all in the same two-week timespan. The unemployed father of four was spotted having dinner at Trump Hotel’s BLT Prime restaurant in Washington, DC just moments after being fired, reports Raw Story. But, he wasn’t alone! Anthony was allegedly enjoying dinner with Katrina Pierson, 41, a political strategist who also appears as a contributor on CNN from time-to-time. Katrina is adamantly pro-Trump and was very briefly rumored to be replacing Anthony once he was fired, though she quickly took to Twitter to confirm that was definitely not going to happen.

According to the Daily Mail, Anthony and Katrina were with a small group of people and they chose a corner table in hopes of being secluded from the public. Anthony and Katrina were seated directly next to each other, and eyewitnesses claim that Anthony spent almost the entire meal staring at his phone instead of eating. We’re sure that he was upset about being fired, so this makes total sense. Though it’s unclear what the relationship between Anthony and Katrina is, she also took to Twitter to defend his firing by revealing he was fired at 8am that day and managed to keep the news from leaking to the press. She also didn’t hesitate to poke fun at the rumors they might be dating, though as you can see in the tweet below she doesn’t specifically address the alleged relationship:

Beyonce, 34, is not going down without a fight in her alleged divorce from Jay Z, 45. As the shocking claims about their split get worse and worse, Blue Ivy, 3, seems to be their next battle royale. Will their little girl become the center of a tug of war event?



Even though everyone at HollywoodLife.com is in a Jayonce prayer circle hoping that InTouchWeekly‘s Sept. 21 issue reporting their marriage is over is just a cruel joke, things seem to be getting serious. The latest report reveals that it’s Beyonce who would not only want, but desperately fight to get full custody of their daughter, Blue Ivy.

“She absolutely wants full custody,” a source close to Beyonce told the magazine. “Although she’s prepared to offer Jay visitation.” Ouch. That will be a harsh blow to Jay, especially since the family of three have spent so much time traveling the world together for the past year or so.

For now, all we can do is cross our fingers and hope that all of this Jayonce drama will blow over. Not only are they perfect together on a personal level, but when they work together — more specifically, perform together — it’s like magic. Don’t take the magic away from us, Jayonce!

So will he return to the public eye soon?

Kanye West, 39, is doing well these days, as a source close to the rapper tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively. “He’s feeling very positive and upbeat. Kanye’s done a lot of soul searching over the past year, he’s worked through a lot of issues, and he’s in a better place than he has been for ages,” the insider reveals. Glad to hear it!

As to what Ye has been up to lately? “Kanye has been spending a lot of time in the studio working on his new album, and he believes it’s some of the best music he’s ever produced,” the source shares. “Taking a year out of the spotlight is exactly what he needed, to help get his head together and get back on track.” Nothing wrong with taking some time off! Ye also joined Kid Cudi, 33, on stage in Chicago, IL on Nov. 4 for his first official performance since his breakdown. Hope it means Kanye will head out on tour again soon!

Oh, and don’t believe the rumors — Kim and Kanye are doing just fine, thank you. “Their marriage is flourishing,” the source insists. “He’s really looking forward to the new baby arriving.” Fortunately, Kimye’s surrogate is reportedly about seven months along, so he won’t have to wait much more!

“How did this get approved by an entire marketing team? Why is okay to tell young kids being fat = ugly?”

The actress wrote,

“I have now fully reviewed the [marketing] for Red Shoes, I am just as appalled and angry as everyone else, this wasn’t approved by me or my team. Pls know I have let the producers of the film know.

Angelina Jolie, 41, has a new home in Los Angeles…and it’s stunning. It’s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B. DeMille’s historic mansion, and now, she’s bit the bullet, putting down a $25 million offer, according to TMZ. The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.

Cecil’s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There’s tons of space for the six kids, too — the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.

This huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53. The possibility of that big move happening seemed even more likely after reports surfaced on April 12 that Angie had met and fallen in love with a British philanthropist and businessman, whose identity has not been revealed.

The actress is reportedly already serious with this mystery man, and a family friend told InTouch that she’s even planning on marrying him! However, we also know that Brad and Angie’s divorce has been much more amicable recently, and she’s been letting him spend more and more time with the kids. Perhaps staying in Los Angeles is her way of making sure Pax, Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox continue to have a relationship with their father? Either way, the house is insane — check it out in the gallery above.

Miranda Kerr and Snapchat CEO and founder Evan Spiegel are making it official — with help from a geofilter, of course.

The happy couple are engaged, Kerr announced on Instagram, Wednesday. “I said yes!!!” she declared, alongside a photo of her gorgeous new bling, which was, of course, snapped with one of Spiegel’s social media company’s filters – this one, specially designed to feature Bitmoji caricatures of the couple during the big moment. (Snapchat just confirmed its acquisition of Bitmoji.)

Kerr’s ring featured a round-cut center diamond, set between two tapered baguettes.

The 33-year-old Australian model and Spiegel, 26, were first spotted together in Los Angeles in June of last year. The pair met at a Louis Vuitton dinner in 2014, starting a friendship that eventually developed into more, she told E! News last year. They’ve remained largely out of the spotlight, but most recently stepped out together for the State Dinner for Nordic leaders at the White House this May.

Kerr previously dished on the romance to The Edit in January, explaining of her love, “He acts like he’s 50. He’s not out partying. He goes to work in Venice [Beach]. He comes home. We don’t go out.”

She added that the pair are decidedly low key, and would rather “be at home and have dinner, go to bed early.”

“He’s just a really kind person and very genuine and very authentic and I really appreciate that about him,” she gushed to E! News. “And also he’s very intelligent.”

The former Victoria’s Secret Angel was previously married to Orlando Bloom, with whom she shares son, Flynn, 5. The pair split after three years of marriage in 2013.

“I think I knew I had something special when the cast came together. And then I guess that first screening I understood that people related to the film like this. To me it’s one of the greatest performances. Casey [Affleck] really nailed it. Me and Casey just tried to focus on what is happening with that character and what he’s trying to do and what is getting in his way. It sounds kind of simple cause you do that with every character. But this character is dealing with a terrible loss while also trying to figure out to function. And I think Casey is so good at narrowing those waters, and always asked the right questions about the character. I didn’t really need to say that much. He liked to explore and I liked to explore, which made the experience that much more enjoyable.”",fake

The 41-year-old country singer defended his fellow American Idol judge after her headline-making kiss with contestant Benjamin Glaze, explaining on The Morning Show on Monday that the smooch was just ""fun TV.""

During Glaze's audition on Idol's season premiere, he confessed to the judges that he had never been kissed, just moments before Perry asked him for a kiss on the cheek, turning her head and kissing him on the lips. In an interview with The New York Times, Glaze said the kiss made him ""uncomfortable immediately"" and that he wished it could have been saved for his first relationship. He later clarified his comments to ET, calling the kiss ""harmless.""

“It’s unfortunate that stuff like that turns into a story that big,” Bryan said on The Morning Show. “I watched an actual interview where Ben, the kid that was involved, said that he was cool with everything.”

""I gotta back Katy on that. She’s in there working hard and making fun TV,"" he continued.

Bryan did admit that he, Perry and Lionel Richie aren't perfect, saying, ""We are going to get it right sometimes and get it wrong sometimes.""

""We’re in there critiquing people. I may say something one day that everybody’s not going to like. That’s just what you signed up for,” he shared. “At the end of the day, me and Lionel and Katy and Ryan [Seacrest], our hearts are in the right place.”

In Glaze's interview with ET, he said he didn't think Perry ""had any malicious intent"" by kissing him before his audition.

""Honestly it was show business. It was just kind of fun and games,"" he said. ""Obviously it's gotten a huge amount of publicity, and I am more thankful for that than not.""

""Before that, I had never kissed a girl, so I don't have anything to compare it to, to be honest,"" Glaze continued, guessing he'd rate the kiss at a ""seven."" ""She seemed like she knew what she was doing.""

During former Bachelorette contestant Eric Bigger’s podcast, Bigger Talks, on Wednesday, Jackson shared details of his friendly relationship with Olympios, even sharing their Valentine’s Day date plans.

“I can’t wait for tonight,” he said.

“Just for the fact that – you know, we’re homies. We’re really good friends, and you know, we just enjoy each other’s company and we like to take things slow,” Jackson added.

Further clarifying, “We hang out. We have fun, and you know, that’s it.”

Despite the BiP sex scandal that rocked season 4’s production last summer, Jackson and Olympios remain close.

The pair has been spotted out and about multiple times over the past few months, sharing a friendly embrace in late August, leaving TAO restaurant in Hollywood in late September, and most recently celebrating Halloween together in Los Angeles.

In October, Jackson opened up about his friendship with Olympios.

“In the media — the media wanted black versus white. They wanted angry black guy, they wanted this little white girl. But in reality, both of us were put against each other,” he said at the time.

“It was one of those things that people want us not to be friends. They want to paint a particular narrative. Even now the narrative is they’re friends now,” he explained. “It’s like, ‘Oh, it’s fake.’ It’s always you’re damned if you do, you’re damned if you don’t.”",fake

Amal Clooney‘s basically perfect — incredibly intelligent, massively successful, a humanitarian, and devastatingly beautiful. Naturally, Brad Pitt would want to be around someone like the famed human rights attorney married to his good friend, George Clooney. That’s why Brad allegedly sought Amal’s help in finding a new friend, according to an anonymous source who spoke to OK! Magazine. “Amal knows Neri through mutual friends and thought she and Brad would be the perfect fit,” the source said.

Don’t get your hopes up about these new friends, though. Brad and Neri’s friendship is strictly professional, and he was actually referred to her because of her amazing credentials, a source told HollywoodLife. Reports about Brad and Neri’s friendship started at the beginning of April, with Page Six claiming that the two met through an architecture project at MIT, where Neri’s a professor.

Even if there were sparks between the two, Neri would never pursue a romantic relationship, a source close to the professor told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY “Neri is feeling the pressure of spending time with Brad. She feels like all eyes are on her in Boston and she is getting more attention than ever before. Friends and family are constantly asking her about Brad which is something that she did not expect.” Totally understandable.

Julia Roberts will be bringing her acting expertise to the small screen for an upcoming psychological thriller, titled Homecoming. The first teaser trailer debuted at Comic-Con last week (where we spotted some of the best-dressed celebrities) and the film is expected to debut this November.

If you’re a fan of the Oscar-winning actress, then you’ll be even more excited to know that the star will be reunited with her My Best Friend’s Wedding co-star, Dermot Mulroney, for the upcoming series.

While the star has always had fun pushing the limits of festival dressing—who can forget last year’s epic Gucci bodysuit or the Matthew Adams Dolan deconstructed denim?—this go round proved her most daring. Pulling out transparent Y/Project, custom Chrome Hearts, and a face-covering balaclava that rendered her almost incognito, she took style risks few others would attempt—exactly what she and Fenty creative director Jahleel Weaver were going for. “Coachella should always be fun and disruptive,” shared Weaver via email. “We had such a moment last year with the Gucci crystal bodysuit and mask, so how do we top that?”

Upping the ante meant entering the planning stage early. Though they started to officially brainstorm a month in advance, when Weaver and Rihanna saw a great piece during February’s fashion month, they made a mental note. Case in point: the moment the balaclava turned up at Alessandro Michele’s autumn/winter 2018 Gucci show, it was destined to be worn. “Ri and I both instantly loved it when it came down the runway,” says Weaver. “So we started to think of what’s the next opportunity to wear this? The Gucci team is so great to us and such a pleasure to work with and they made it happen.” The love at first sight rule also applied to the gauzy Y/Project creation, which came with extreme UGGs that made it an outside the box choice: “It was just so NOT Coachella that it made us love the idea even more.”",fake

Written by Monya Fleming:





Is Rihanna Really Pregnant?: Leonardo DiCaprio or Drake the Father?





There are reports that Rihanna is pregnant with her first child, which leads us to ask if actor Leonardo DiCaprio is the father...or Rihanna's ex, Drake?

MTO claims they have had contact with a member of Rihanna's camp that has revealed Rihanna has stopped drinking, stopped smoking weed, and is not smoking cigarettes. Maybe she is just trying to be healthier?

The site also claims that a close friend of RiRi's said the singer did not even smoke marijuana on 4/20 and does not want any weed smoked around her.

MediaTakeout.com also notes that Rihanna's belly is a little poochy, wondering if she has a small baby bump.



If Rihanna is indeed pregnant, would the father more likely be rapper Drake or Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio. She has been rumored to be seen with both men on occasion in the past month.









They report that Rihanna is not pregnant, debunking another Rihanna pregnant story posted by MTO.





The site reports, ""She wasn’t expecting when MediaFakeOut claimed it in 2011, or in 2014, when the webloid actually said it was willing to bet $10,000 that the star was with child. Just like now, the site said Rihanna had given up weed and Drake could be the daddy. And then came a story last fall that once again said Rihanna was pregnant, this time with rapper Travis Scott’s baby.""





Rihanna has made no secret that she has baby fever, but is the singer really ready to start a family?





The ""Work"" singer has wanted a child ever since the birth of her cousin’s baby girl, Majesty. The singer shared photos on social media of herself holding the baby, writing, ""I can’t get enough, I’m so in love.""





Last year Rihanna speaks opened up about having children with Glamour Magazine. She told the publication, ""One day I will have kids. I look forward to the day when I’m gonna be a mom. But I’m nowhere close. I don’t even have a potential baby daddy!""

President Trump's attorney Marc Kasowitz will deliver comments at the National Press Club.

Comey confirmed Wednesday that President Trump requested his loyalty and later urged him to drop the investigation into ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, according to a preview of his opening statement. Comey describes one meeting at the White House in which he said Trump strongly defended Flynn, saying that his former national security adviser “hadn’t done anything wrong’’ in his prior contact with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go,’’ Comey said, quoting the president. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.’’

-7181745288,Kanye West Is Staying With Caitlyn Jenner Following Slavery Comments and Twitter Rant,"



After Kanye West spiraled out of control on Twitter last week, his family is keeping their distance. The 40-year-old rapper went on a bizarre rant about philosophy, “the psychological zombie effect,” and his love for Donald Trump. He even shared photos of himself wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat. But things took a turn for the worse when Kanye suggested that 400 years of slavery was a choice during a TMZ interview, and now Kim Kardashian is at “her breaking point.” According to Life & Style, the mother-of-three wants a divorce after Kanye’s latest outburts. However, it looks like there’s still one person who’s welcoming him with open arms — and that’s Caitlyn Jenner.

“Kanye’s been staying at Cait’s the past few nights,” an insider exclusively tells In Touch. “She’s literally the only woman in the Kardashian clan who’s showing him major love as he expresses his political views. She understands him. She gets him. She loves him. And she’s incredibly supportive of his conservative views and only wants to encourage him to be his best self — just like he supported her when she was transitioning.”

It’s no secret Caitlyn has been a longtime supporter of Trump, even when people slammed her for betraying the LGBTQ communtiy. But more than that, Caitlyn — who has a distant relationship with the Kardashians after bashing Kris Jenner in her memoir — understands what it’s like to be at the center of controversy.

“He’s feeling a tremendous amount of resentment and backlash from his wife and her family, his friends in the hip-hop community, and many of his fans,” the source explains. “But through it all, he’s found peace, serenity, acceptance, and comfort in Cait’s house and he’ll never forget how much she’s been there for him.”

As previously reported by In Touch, Kim is mostly concerned about her husband ruining her family’s brand. “Kim is losing it,” the source revealed. “She doesn’t want Kanye putting himself out there like he’s doing because it’s ruining his brand and her family’s image. She thinks he’s doing more damage to their empire than good.”",fake

The axing means that last Sunday’s finale — which ended on a cliffhanger — will now serve as a series finale.

Last Man on Earth this season averaged a 0.8 demo rating and just under 2 million total weekly viewers (in Live+Sane Day numbers), down a tick from Season 3 and ranking sixth in the demo out of Fox’s nine comedies.

-934438,"Christina Aguilera Goes Back To Basics On Soul-Baring ‘Liberation’ Ballad, ‘Twice’!","Fresh off announcing her upcoming The Liberation Tour and duet performance for “Fall In Line” with Demi Lovato at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards later this month, Christina Aguilera has released another new song from her upcoming album Liberation: “Twice“!

Here’s the thing: Xtina‘s grand return to the music scene, “Accelerate,” is fine, but it’s not the most comeback-ready or awe-inspiring track of 2018, real talk. (It’s cool, but it’s certainly no “Dirrty” or “Your Body.”)

“Twice,” however, is what I’m talking about: The “Telepathy” chanteuse is going Back To Basics on the emotional ballad. Yupp, “Twice” is another (refreshingly) restrained moment for Christina, allowing her emotionally charged powerhouse pipes to take the full spotlight on the track without drowning out the beautiful melodies with her exaggerated vocal runs. She’s always truly shined in ballad form, and “Twice” is no exception — the Stripped-back intro and outro, especially are chill-inducing moments.

How does it factor within the grand scheme of all Xtina ballads? It’s not as immediately memorable as “Hurt,” “You Lost Me” or “Beautiful,” but it’s an undeniably gorgeous listen for true lovers of balladry – and it only gets better with each replay. Christina‘s still one of the best vocalists in the game, and this track is further proof of her true talent.

What’s clear is that we should expect the unexpected this time around, ya dig?

Christina Aguilera’s latest “Twice” is also available on Apple Music and Spotify!",real

Speaking to Ellen DeGeneres on the comedienne’s talk show on Thursday, Fonda said, “If you had told me when I was 20 or 30 that I would actually still be acting, still active at 80 on a show like this, I would have said, ‘You’re out of your mind. There’s no way.’ No, I didn’t think I’d live this long. Everyday I get up and I want to pinch myself. I feel very blessed, but I’ve worked for it.”

After taking a 15 year break from 1990 to 2005, Fonda has since been working consistently in movies and TV and is currently starring in the Netflix show Grace & Frankie as well as the upcoming movie Book Club.

It’s a much different life than she thought she’d have. Fonda admitted she thought she’d “die lonely and probably from alcohol or something like that.”

“The fact that I’m not an addict, and I’m 80 and I’m working—it’s just a miracle to me,” she explained.

The actress opened up about how differently she looks at life now that she has so much experience behind her. After admitting that she wouldn’t want to be in her 20s again, she is thankful for the wisdom she’s gained since.

“If you have a whole lot of time behind you and just a little in front of you, as is the case with me, I can look back and say, ‘Well, I’ve survived that,'” she said. “You know, friends have died. There’s been divorces; there’s been all kinds of difficult things. I survived. You don’t sweat the small stuff, right? You don’t make mountains out of mole hills.”

Before the big day comes promposals, which can be intimidating — especially when you don't know which way it's going to go. Fear, however, did not stop a Burger King in Lynn, Massachusetts from asking the Wendy's next door (very publicly) to prom via a storefront sign.

“@WENDYS PROM?” Burger King's marquee read.

Frankly, we'd be a little scared if we were Burger King waiting for a reply back from Wendy's, who's delivered some pretty savage burns this year to their competitors on Twitter. This time though, the red head spared BK and agreed to go — under a few conditions.

“OK, but don’t get handsy and we have to be home by 10,” Wendy’s tweeted.

Burger King then changed their sign and it's pretty adorable.

""@wendys looking forward to it. let’s aim for king and queen of prom,"" BK tweeted with a photo of the new sign that reads, ""SHE SAID YES! ""



Twitter users are totally loving the fast food romance, too, flooding their tweets with replies to the saga.

Moon Pie, the snack company behind those marshmallow-filled, chocolate-covered pies made with graham crackers, is another brand who's social media game has been crazy strong as of lately. Seizing the opportunity to get in on the viral moment, they responded with a hinge of playful jealousy for not asking Wendy's first.



The pig-tailed fast food chain may have let Burger King slide this time by saying yes to prom, but McDonald's did not receive the same treatment. Wendy's threw a couple quick jabs at McDonald's via Twitter.

Ouch.

Apparently Wendy's super bowl ad trolling Mickey D's wasn't enough social media savagery for one year.

According to her caption, the 45-year-old Goop founder was pregnant with the older of her two children when the revealing image was taken. Apple Martin, whose father is Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, turns 14 on May 14, making it a double celebration of sorts for the family.

Paltrow’s not the only star who chose to share a private pregnancy photo for Mother’s Day. Actor Ian Somerhalder marked wife Nikki Reed’s first Mother’s Day as a parent by posting a nude maternity photo from her pregnancy with their daughter, Bodhi Soleil, who turns 1 in July.

Somerhalder himself took the photo, which was “liked” by Reed on Instagram. Like Paltrow, she is completely unclothed and using her hand to cover her chest.

Many fans were touched by the Vampire Diaries star’s tribute to his wife, saying they “need someone like [him]” in their lives.

So, the public approves. Whether or not the “babies” themselves will — kids will be kids, after all — remains to be seen.

-935076,Long-Lost Twins Carla Bruni and Bella Hadid Finally Met in Cannes,"No, it’s not your imagination. Current A-list model Bella Hadid and original ’90s supermodel Carla Bruni bare a striking resemblance to one another, and even they agree. Indeed, he two models were finally spotted together and posed for an illustrative side-by-side snapshot. The fateful meeting took place at the Cannes Film Festival. So any conspiracy theories that the two are the same person or there’s some sort of time travel involved can end, but where conspiracy theory ends, another begins. Uploading the photo to Instagram on Monday, Bruni decided to start a rumor of her own. “Do I have a hidden daughter? @bellahadid,” the former first lady of France wrote in the caption.

The whole thing was orchestrated by none other than Naomi Campbell, who invited the two to her charity gala dinner on Sunday night. The dinner was preceded by her annual Fashion for Relief fashion show, which Campbell threw in order to raise funds for Save the Children and Time’s Up, Vanity Fair reported. This year’s Fashion for Relief theme was “Race to Equality.” “I feel like we are taking two steps forward and one step back,” Campbell said at the event, according to Vanity Fair. “We look up to our world leaders—we are supposed to look up to our world leaders…I have seen things. I just got back from Africa two days ago, and we are not where we should be.”

“It’s what’s happening right now. It’s in our faces. Why shouldn’t it?” Campbell told Vanity Fair about her decision to raise money for Time’s Up. “And I think for every successful man there is a very strong and powerful woman.”

The fashion show, which has been raising money for different causes since 2005, featured Hadid, Winnie Harlow, and Campbell herself, among other supermodels, The Sun reported. Kendall Jenner was also in attendance. Although she didn’t walk the runway, according to The Sun, she later joined Hadid, Campbell, Bruni, and others backstage before moving to the star-studded gala dinner.

However, those were shot down — and the James Mangold film didn’t even have a post-credits sequence. The closest we got was the Deadpool teaser that played in theaters with Logan.

The two starred together in 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine. However, Reynolds has long pushed for a team-up movie with Jackman and to have him appear in Deadpool 2.

Molly Ephraim and Flynn Morrison, who played Mandy and Boyd Baxter — the middle daughter and grandson, respectively, of Tim Allen‘s Mike Baxter — during the series’ run on ABC, have opted not to return for Season 7. Both roles are in the process of being recast, Deadline has confirmed.

Created by Jack Burditt, Last Man Standing stars Allen as a married father of three girls who tries to maintain his manliness in a world increasingly dominated by women.

Also back is co-star Hector Elizondo whose deal to return — made last month — was originally in second position to his NBC comedy pilot Guess Who Died. That pilot was not picked up by the network and was shopped unsuccessfully. The options on the cast recently lapsed, rendering everyone, including Elizondo, available to take other series jobs.

Kevin Abbott, who served as an executive producer on the original series for most of its six seasons on ABC, with stints as showrunner in Season 1 and the second half of Season 6, is back as executive producer/showrunner for Season 7.

“His passing was a great loss for the music world and for us,” The Chainsmokers’ Drew Taggart said. “He was an artist who inspired so many in so many ways, and simply put, he meant so much to us and everyone in the EDM community.”

-936196,4 people Blake Lively dated before she met husband Ryan Reynolds,"Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds are arguably the most endearing couple in Hollywood right now. They're both accomplished actors with style and humor, and their two young daughters make their family even more adorable.

The couple is going on six years of marriage this September, but Lively had to kiss a few frogs before finding her *prince* (or anti-hero, technically). The list is not very long, with only four significant others making the cut, but it is distinguished. Lively said herself in a 2012 interview with Elle that she's selective about who she dates — and clearly, that approach has served her well.

Gomez met a ton of fans and managed to make another good joke at her Met Gala spray tan that drew a lot of critical tweets because it didn't photograph well on the red carpet. ""I fixed it from Met Gala,"" she quipped of her bronze glow to fans complimenting her appearance.

Gomez's first joke about the tan was posted three days after the Met Gala. ""Me when I saw my pictures from MET,"" she wrote with a shrug emoji and footage of her running away.

A source made it clear to People then that Gomez was joking only about the tan and hair, not her dress. “In person, she honestly felt great but not everything looks the same as it does in person,” the source explained. “She was just clapping back at people who were commenting on her tan and hair and wanted to make a joke about it.”



Gomez herself shared several videos of herself meeting fans yesterday on her Instagram story. She changed her hair again for the event, making it long with extensions. She appears to still be wearing her cross necklace from the Met Gala, too.

“You just have to make time for date night, time for yourself alone and time with your partner – it has to be fun!” She explained, “My husband always says, ‘We can’t stop dating.’ I love that because it’s true. You have to continue to make the space for yourself and your partner to just have fun like you did before you had kids. And not talk about them! Keep it fresh, keep it exciting.

-936697,‘Once Upon a Time’ Star Lana Parrilla Won’t Play Regina in Rebooted Season 7,"“Once Upon a Time” fans may need to bid farewell to yet another character.

Lana Parrilla, who is one of few core cast members returning for the ABC drama’s rebooted seventh season, told reporters at the Television Critics Association’s summer press tour that her Evil Queen character will no longer go by her Storybrooke name of Regina Mills.

“I don’t think her name is Regina, and that’s cool,” the actress said. “I’m no longer in pantsuits — I’m in denim and rock T-shirts. When we meet her, this other version of Regina, she’s working in a bar. She’s a little rough around the edges.”

Parilla acknowledged that other returning characters will emphasize unfamiliar aspects of their personalities in the new season, but that this will be especially true for the Evil Queen: “She looks very different — she feels different.”

“She’s no longer in charge,” Parrilla continued. “This version of Regina is something else. I’m still discovering her. I think we’re all still discovering who she is — it’s refreshing.”

When a journalist wanted to know the name that the other characters will now call Regina, Parilla replied cagily, “I can’t tell you — you’ll have to tune in.”

This led series co-creator Edward Kitsis to quip, “‘The Queen Formally Known as Regina’ will also work.”

New cast member Andrew J. West, who plays the adult version of Henry Mills, said that viewers will see Regina and Henry “interact in a way that you’ve never seen them.”

Meanwhile, “Once” co-creator Adam Horowitz pointed out that the pair’s “relationship is central to the show, and remains so.”

ABC announced in May that Season 7, which launches Oct. 6, will be without such core cast members as Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow), Josh Dallas (Charming) and Jennifer Morrison (Emma).",real

In another post, John celebrated his 14-year-long run in Vegas.

Cyrus and John performed a duet of ""Tiny Dancer"" at the GRAMMY Awards in January. Leading up to that night — and a GRAMMY tribute concert later that week — John spoke to ET about his love for the 25-year-old pop star.

""I love Miley. I just asked her if she'd do [the duet] with me and she said yes and she's going to be on the TV special as well,"" he gushed. ""The great thing about the GRAMMYs is that backstage you meet people you haven't met before and it's great when you hang out. It's very cool to meet these kinds of people you don't normally meet, so I'm really looking forward to that.""

Ragland, who wore a stunning pastel green Oscar de la Renta dress and coat (designed by creative directors Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia), took her seat in the second row of one of the side pews inside St. George's Chapel, where Markle and Harry's wedding took place Saturday.

Her seat was reportedly right across from Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who sat beside her husband, Prince Philip.



Cameras captured Ragland as she was overcome with emotion throughout the ceremony, particularly when Markle and Harry exchanged their vows.

On social media, people commended Markle's mother for attending and sitting at the wedding alone. Ragland and Markle's father, Thomas Markle Sr., divorced in 1987, and it was announced that he was unable to attend the wedding after suffering a heart attack earlier this week.

""Beautifiully [sic] dressed Doria sitting alone in such a beautiful historical moment shows strength, & grace that must be an inspiration to Meghan,"" one user wrote. ""This is the reality of many single parents.""

""Kudos to #DoriaRagland for sitting there alone representing,"" another said. ""It can't be easy with all that pressure and scrutiny.""

Royal expert Alastair Bruce spoke with Town and Country leading up to the nuptials, and explained how much input Markle and Harry have in deciding who gets invited and who sits where at the wedding.



""It’s very much a matter for the bride and the groom,"" Bruce said, adding that the couple enlists the help of The Lord Chamberlain's Office when deciding the seating chart. ""They will assist him. They know the layout of St. George’s Chapel, and they will guide him.""

His bride, Meghan Markle, will be known as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex after today's ceremony.

""The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel,"" a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said. ""Prince Harry thus becomes His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, and Ms. Meghan Markle on marriage will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.""

[NATL] Royal Wedding 2018: Best Moments From Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's Wedding

The previous Duke of Sussex was married twice, but neither marriage was approved by his father. As such, they were considered unlawful. And so, Meghan is the first Duchess of Sussex.

It is customary for members of the Royal Family to be offered at least one title by the monarch upon marriage. The titles, ranked from highest to lowest are: duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron for men; and duchess, marchioness, countess, viscountess, and baroness for women.

If the 33-year-old prince had turned down the title, he would've remained HRH Prince Harry of Wales. His 36-year-old bride would have likely been known as HRH Princess Harry of Wales, rather than HRH Princess Meghan, since the former actress is not a princess in her own right.

The Duke of Sussex was widley seen as the most likely choice for Harry, but other possibilities were the dukedoms of Albany, Clarence, Connaught, Cumberland and Teviotdale, and Windsor.

Prince William and Kate Middleton received their titles before their 2011 wedding. ""The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince William of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus,"" Buckingham Palace said at the time.

-936760,Evangeline Lilly Blames ‘Misogynistic’ Stunt Coordinator for ‘Lost’ Set Injury,"Evangeline Lilly recalled sustaining a pretty intense injury on the set of “Lost,” and blamed a bullying stunt coordinator for making her go through with it.

Speaking at a panel Wednesday night on Fox’s Los Angeles lot about women working in the stunt business, Lilly said that she expressed hesitation over a stunt she was asked to do without any protection on her forearms.

“There were open wounds, pus-y and oozing,” she said at the panel, according to Deadline, adding that the stunt coordinator was “misogynistic” and wouldn’t allow her to wear moleskin on her forearms as protection. She said that the liquid bandage New Skin was painfully applied after several of the takes. She said the stunt coordinator, who she did not name, told her the moleskin would be seen on camera.

“I looked like a mutant. My mom said, ‘You’ll never be able to wear an evening gown again!’” she said.

The stunt in question involved rolling off a tree branch and then hanging above the ground (she was harnessed to the branch to prevent falling), the actress recalled. Lilly said that she did the stunt multiple times, and each time more skin ripped from her forearms.

“I felt it was him saying, ‘I’m going to put you in your place for standing up to me,’” Lilly said of the stunt coordinator. “It was either cow to his power or hurt myself. I was in my twenties then. Now, I would probably back down.”

A rep for ABC, Lilly and studio Bad Robot did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on the alleged incident.",real

Topping off her look, Kate accessorized with a matching fuchsia fascinator and veil paired with classic black pumps and a clutch. Her McQueen dress featured a pleated waistline and puffed sleeves. Typically one to stick to a neutral color palette, the look made for an unexpected splash of color for the Duchess of Cambridge.

After arriving with Prince William, the couple shared a rare moment of PDA inside St. George's Chapel, holding hands sweetly as they sat in the pews.

During the ceremony, the couple was seated without their two eldest kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, because the tots were busy serving as pageboy and bridesmaid in the ceremony.

For her last royal wedding appearance, at the May nuptials for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Kate also wore an Alexander McQueen dress. It was the third time she re-wore the pale yellow frock—she had previously worn it to both Princess Charlotte's christening and to Queen Elizabeth II's birthday party.

The wedding, which took place at Windsor Castle in England, drew around an estimated 29 million viewers in the U.S., Nielsen data reveals. That figure is based on the 15 channels that aired the wedding ceremony live, and measures the number of viewers that tuned in when the ceremony officially started at 7 a.m. EST and wrapped at 8:15 a.m. EST. There were also 6.9 million total interactions across Facebook and Twitter regarding the royal wedding, according to Nielsen data.

-936761,Meghan Markle's Dog Rides with the Queen Elizabeth to Windsor,"Please be seated for the most important announcement about the royal wedding: Meghan Markle's dog, Guy, was just in Windsor with the Queen. The bride-to-be's beagle was seen living his best life yesterday, peeking out the window while hitching a ride with her Majesty. (They're carpool buddies now. No big deal.)

We haven't even seen Meghan alone in a car with the sovereign, but here's Guy, four legged and all, riding in the back seat with the Queen.



Much like his mom, Guy has been on an pretty incredible journey over the past few years. Before Meghan adopted him in 2015, he was going to be put down by a shelter in Kentucky after he was discovered in the woods but no one wanted to take him home, according to The Guardian.

He was then taken in by Dolores Doherty, who runs A Dog's Dream Rescue, an Ontario-based charity that saves beagles on the kill list in the US and brings them to Canada for refuge.

After Guy traveled a 500-mile journey to the border, Doherty brought him to an adoption event just outside Toronto, where Meghan was living while filming Suits. Surely enough, Markle turned out to be one of the hopeful dog owners at the event.



Guy has moved to London with Meghan, a Kensington Palace rep confirmed in November. Markle's other dog, Bogart, couldn't make the trip across the pond due to his old age, The Guardian adds.

Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II with one of her corgis in 1970

A love of dogs is something Markle shares with her grandmother-in-law, who's known to be very fond of corgis. Just last month, Her Majesty's last corgi, Willow, passed away at the age of 14. Perhaps hanging out with her new four-legged friend, Guy, has helped fill that hole.

Markle also instantly connected with the Queen's dogs, saying they laid happily at her feet during tea when she first met them. “For 33 years, [I’ve been] barked at, and this one walks in, and absolutely nothing, just wagging tails,” Harry recalled in their first interview together.

The personalities were on display out the steps outside the chapel – the young princess waved to the crowd as her older brother shyly hid behind the other bridesmaids.

The design on the bridesmaid and page boy uniforms incorporated the Mark Bradford artwork included in the Order of Service.

Charlotte had no compunction with modeling for the cameras.

Her bridesmaid flowers, which included posies of Lily of the Valley and spray roses, reflected the bridal bouquet designed by Rob Van Helden.

She also gave a smile and waved to the crowd while arriving for the ceremony in a car with other bridesmaids and page boys.

-937115,Meghan Markle Spotted Her Old Drama Teacher During the Royal Carriage Ride,"Before Meghan Markle married Prince Harry and became the Duchess of Sussex, she was a working actress in Hollywood. She appeared on television shows like Deal or No Deal and films like Remember Me, but her most notable role was as Rachel Zane on American TV show Suits, which she appeared on from 2011 to 2017. But on her wedding day, her worlds collided when a surprise guest showed up.

After the nuptials at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, the happy couple embarked on a carriage ride through London. However, they had no idea that ITV News, an English news station, had a special guest waiting for them.

Gigi Perreau, Markle's former drama teacher and 1940s film star, was a guest of ITV as an exclusive contributor. As the carriage grew closer, Perreau wondered aloud if the new duchess would recognize her. She was right.

In the video, Markle sees her old teacher and exclaims ""Oh my God,"" as she makes direct eye contact before the carriage pulls away. It causes Harry to look at her as well. Perreau is obviously delighted, and the acknowledgment makes for a sweet moment in the midst of what's a long and exciting day for the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex.",real

On a night riding high on female empowerment, it was fitting the show ended with a stage full of strong women.

Salt-N-Pepa opened with quick, potent trifecta: the head-nod suite “Shoop,” the kinetic “Let’s Talk About Sex” – in the crowd, Ne-Yo was spotted crooning the hook – and the breathless classic, “Push It.” They were joined by the three singers in En Vogue for a triumphant rendition of their 1993 hit, “Whatta Man.”

Salt-N-Pepa originally released “Push It” in 1987 as the b-side to their song, “Tramp,” before putting it out as its own single a year later. “Push It” quickly became a crossover smash, ultimately peaking at Number 19 on the Hot 100 and making Salt-N-Pepa the first female rappers to crack the Top 20. Salt-N-Pepa’s success continued over the next few years. “Whatta Man” became their highest charting song, reaching Number Three on the Hot 100.

Salt-N-Pepa continue to tour regularly and are set to embark on a summer trek June 8th at the Brandon Amphitheater in Brandon, Mississippi. The group also recently announced they would kick off a residency in Las Vegas later this year.",real

French authorities have since opened an investigation into the 59-year-old French director after the new report from Europe 1 surfaced. The actress—who has purportedly known Besson for years—has remained anonymous.

The actress said that while she and Besson were meeting at the luxury hotel Le Bristol in Paris, the director put something in her tea. She later felt out of it and lost consciousness. When she woke up, she alleged that he was touching and penetrating her. She also reported that the director left the hotel before her and left her with a number of outstanding bills. Afterwards, she went to a friend's house to feel more secure.

Besson’s lawyer, Thierry Marembert told The Hollywood Reporter on Saturday, “Mr. Besson fell from his chair when he learned of these accusations, which he flatly denies.”

Besson is a world-renowned actor who has won a BAFTA award and earned 10 César nominations. He directed 1997's The Fifth Element, 2014's Lucy, and 2017's Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, and produced the Taken trilogy.

“It was very off-the-cuff, which was lovely,” the guest revealed. “He promised that all the Americans wouldn’t steal the swords and said, ‘Please, when you leave, be quiet as you don’t want to wake the neighbors,’ which was quite fun.”

“My home state has had so much heartbreak over this past year. And once again, we’re grieving for more kids that have died,” the singer and host of The Voice said, referring to the shooting at Santa Fe High School in Texas, where 10 people were killed at least 10 others wounded by 17-year-old suspected gunman Dimitrios Pagourtzis on Friday.

The incident recalled the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in February, which killed 17 people and sparked a national debate about gun violence.

Clarkson, who was hosting the Billboard Music Awards, reiterated that call for action in a sometimes emotional plea, saying that “we’re failing our children” by allowing them to continue to face the risk of gun violence in schools, churches, and movie theaters.

“So Miles, of course, is the same name as the great Miles Davis,” the 39-year-old Oscar and Grammy winner added. “And Chrissy really liked the name Theodore, so we put it all together and got Miles Theodore Stephens. When he came out and we hung out with him for a little, we were like, ‘He looks like a Miles.’”

But apparently, they weren't talented or funny enough to deliver the type of Han Solo film Lucasfilm was looking for.

Per the EW piece, Lord and Miller took an experimental approach to Solo: A Star Wars Story. The filmmakers were open to improvisation. Improvisation isn't discouraged in the Star Wars franchise, yet Lord and Miller's approach was allegedly slowing things down. Kathleen Kennedy explains:

""I think these guys are hilarious, but they come from a background of animation and sketch comedy and when you are making these movies you can do that and there's plenty of room for improvisation, we do that all the time, but it has to be inside of a highly structured process or you can't get the work done and you can't move the armies of people to anticipate and have things ready. So, it literally came down to process. Just getting it done.""

This squares with the statement Lord and Miller released after they left the production:

""Unfortunately, our vision and process weren't aligned with our partners on this project. We normally aren't fans of the phrase 'creative differences' but for once this cliché is true. We are really proud of the amazing and world-class work of our cast and crew.""

""I think everybody went in with really good intentions and our approach to making the movie was different than theirs,"" Lord said later (via Vulture). ""That was a really big gap to bridge, and it proved to be too big...Sometimes people break up, and it's really sad, and it's really disappointing, but it happens and we learned a lot from our collaborators and we're better filmmakers for it.""",real

In a statement to Billboard, Avicii’s family wrote:

“There have been many inquiries regarding the funeral arrangements for Tim Bergling, known by music fans as Avicii. The Bergling family has now confirmed that the funeral will be private, in the presence of the people who were closest to Tim. They kindly ask media to respect this. There is no additional information forthcoming.”

On April 20, 2018, the EDM community was shook to its core when Avicii’s body was found in his hotel room in Oman. Authorities have since ruled out foul play. An autopsy report has yet to be revealed, although a previous statement from his family implied suicide.

That statement read:

“Our beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who traveled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress. When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be happy and be able to do what he loved most – music. He really struggled with thoughts about Meaning, Life, Happiness. He could not go on any longer…”

As always, Avicii’s family is asking their privacy be respected in this especially difficult time.

Fans will get to hear a new Avicii album with his family’s blessing, according to Swedish magazine Aftonbladet. Details on that here.

RIP, legend.

“Parks and Recreation” ran for seven seasons and 125 episodes between April 2009 and February 2015. The show was never a ratings juggernaut but it was consistently one of the most acclaimed comedies on television. Across its run, the show was nominated twice for the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, while Poehler was nominated four times for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

Other “Parks and Recreation” cast members have gone on record in the past noting their interest in a revival. Aubrey Plaza told Entertainment Tonight at the start of 2018 that she would “do it,” although she did recommend waiting a bit longer since the show only wrapped three years ago. NBC has had great success reviving shows like “Will & Grace,” while ABC’s “Roseanne” revival was one of the biggest shows on television this spring.",real

According to Deadline, the decision to end the drama was a mutual one between Sony Pictures TV, the show's producer, and Lifetime. Hewitt and the network and producers were in a standoff over storylines for the third season.

TVLine reported that Hewitt, who is pregnant with her fiance/co-star Brian Hallisay's baby, wanted to have Hallisay be the father. The producers and Hewitt didn't agree on how to handle the pregnancy.

""The Client List"" was originally a Lifetime original movie that eventually became an ongoing series. Hewitt starred in both.

If you didn't watch the royal wedding over the weekend, here's what you missed.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married.

Reverend Michael Curry was a shining star and also the breath of fresh air we all needed and craved so much.

Prince Phillip looked very old and confused.

And Victoria Beckham didn't smile.

That last occurance, as we all know, is nothing new.

For years now, VB has taken it upon herself not to smile whenever she's out and about. It happens often enough, we're all used to it.

And according to Victoria, it's because the fashion industry has ""stolen"" her smile and that she doesn't crack one out out of respect to the industry.

Fair.

This weekend though, Victoria wasn't lamenting the fact that fashion had stolen her ability to break out her pearly whites.

She was actually relieved... because she wasn't pregnant.

Probably our default state, to be honest.

Victoria told The Evening Standard she was delighted she wasn't expecting a child at this royal wedding, like she was back in 2011 when she attended Will and Kate's big day.

She said:

""Quite honestly, it was such a relief not to be hugely pregnant at this royal wedding that it was a joy to be able to choose anything I wanted to wear.""

VB also recognised that her outfits from both weddings were similar enough, saying: ""I love navy.""

Fair, girl.

Same.

The fashion icon went on to say that the wedding was lovely and that she had a great day.

She said:

""It was such a beautiful, incredible wedding. It was just the best day. ""They looked so happy, and everybody was just so happy for them. Meghan seems like a genuinely lovely woman, who really loves him.""

*In what could double as a storyline for the upcoming season of “Insecure,” co-stars Sarunas J. Jackson and Dominique Perry just had a baby together, and it came as a complete surprise to the woman Jackson was dating at the time.

Jackson, who plays Dro on the show, welcomed a baby girl with Perry, who plays Tasha. On Tuesday, she shared a black and white photo of her newborn daughter, Zen, lying in a hospital crib.

“”Zen”…. you’re so perfect… thank you God for appointing me the wonderful job of being her mommy 💗,” Perry wrote in the caption.

Just hours after Perry announced her daughter’s arrival, Jackson also shared a black and white photo of the baby, tweeting, “NWTS,” along with several hands up, praying and heart eye emojis. Before he shared the photo of Zen, Jackson posted a cryptic tweet on Monday, writing, “11:59 pm May 19th, 2018.” He followed it up with “NWTS,” a reference to Drake’s 2013 album “Nothing Was the Same.”

As if their surprise baby news wasn’t enough, it turns out that the delivery was also a surprise to Kaylen Zahara, Jackson’s apparent girlfriend…who found out about his baby on #TheShadeRoom like everybody else.

Charged with rape, Harvey Weinstein has turned himself into authorities. Leaders of Time's Up, #MeToo and other women's rights movements, including some of the women who say Weinstein raped them, are beginning to react.

About 80 women have come forward with a range of allegations against Weinstein, including rape, harassment and inappropriate comments. He has been charged with rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct involving two separate incidences. The rape charge was comes from an incident with a woman who has not been publicly identified. The other case involves Lucia Evans, who claims Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex during a casting call.

The Women's March released a statement on Friday.

""This is an important day in terms of visibility for all women whose lives have been devastated because of the actions of Harvey Weinstein. We seek justice for women and all people who have been harassed and abused in the workplace. No person should be violated at work, or anywhere else. Ever. Toxic masculinity and misogyny can no longer be ignored or tolerated at the workplace or any other place in society. We stand with the brave women who came forward against Harvey Weinstein. We hope their courage will continue to inspire others to break their silence.""

Rose McGowan, who became one of the most vocal leaders of the #MeToo movement after accusing Weinstein of raping her 20 years ago, spoke out on Good Morning America on Friday.

""I have to admit I didn't think I would see the day that he would have handcuffs on him,"" she said. ""I have a visceral need for him to have handcuffs on.""

-939088,The New Christopher Robin Trailer Hits All The Feels,"1 SHARES Facebook Twitter

A few months ago, we received a teaser trailer for the upcoming Christopher Robin film. It didn’t show a lot of the premise of the film, but what it did show was Winnie the Pooh in live action setting. While there were people the criticised how Pooh looked, the overall thoughts were positive. Having a film that has Pooh search out an older Christopher Robin seems like the exact film we need. Then came the release of a new trailer today, and I can say it hit every emotion it needed.

Christopher Robin is a film that will show an older Christopher Robin, but showing a person who’s forgotten about his past. Winnie the Pooh and friends seem to never forgetting about him, which makes the trailer seem so much more tragic. Anyone who watched cartoons or films of these characters can surely feel this. The film seems to follow a timeline that will allow Christopher Robin to help Pooh, but then make Pooh and friends help Christopher Robin. This is a great concept as it seems while Christopher Robin has forgotten about his furry friends, his friends never forgotten about him. It seems the only conclusion can be a sad one.

Why should fans be excited for this film? Disney is bringing us to a place where we have been in other films, but it’s different since we never saw this with Winnie the Pooh. A film that could be used as a comparison is the 1991 film, Hook, starring Robin Williams as Peter Pan. In Hook, Peter forgets about Neverland and the Lost Boys, but the longer he stayed there, the more he remembered. Christopher Robin will probably be more of a drama than Hook, as Hook was an action film.

Overall, this is the perfect film for the family. The older generations that grew up with Winnie the Pooh, like myself, can enjoy this film with their families. The nostalgic factor is there, but the film doesn’t seem it since this is a live action film. And with today’s technology, Disney can really show us something we’ve never seen before with these characters.

Christopher Robin will be released on August 3, 2018, starring Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet, Tigger and Ewan McGregor (who should be starring in an Obi Wan film soon).

In case you, too, were wondering, the image behind the happy couple appears to be of William and Harry and one on the other table, in the light brown wood frame is a portrait of the Queen's close friend and third cousin Queen Margrethe of Denmark. The British monarch also keeps her handbag close by, as well a pair of glasses, multiple clocks, and various other dishes and small trinkets.

While we don't have any details on this mystery photograph, Lubomirski recently opened up about taking the official wedding portrait of the newly named Duke and Duchess of Sussex. ""It was just one of those magical moments, when you're a photographer and everything falls into place,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.

""The sun is setting right just over the top of Windsor Castle just behind them, it was just the most serene, beautiful light, they're in love, walking around this beautiful garden,"" he continued. ""I said just before you go in, let's sit down on these stairs, and she just slumped in between his legs.""

-940257,"Tom Cruise’s ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Pushed Back to 2020, ‘A Quiet Place’ Sequel Dated","Tom Cruise‘s “Top Gun” sequel, “Top Gun: Maverick,” has been pushed back nearly a year from July 12, 2019, to June 26, 2020.

Paramount Pictures made the announcement on Wednesday. The extra time will give filmmakers the opportunity to work out the logistics of presenting flight sequences with new technology and planes. The sequel will be set in a world of drone technology and will explore the end of the era of dogfighting, with Cruise portraying a flight instructor. In May, Cruise posted a photo of himself in front of what appeared to be a Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet.

“Oblivion” helmer Joe Kosinski is directing the film, a sequel to 1986’s “Top Gun,” from a script by Peter Craig, Justin Marks, and Eric Warren Singer. Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the first movie with the late Don Simpson, will produce with Cruise and Skydance CEO David Ellison.

“Only the Brave” star Miles Teller will play Goose’s son and Maverick’s new protege. Goose, the co-pilot to Cruise’s character in the original, was played by Anthony Edwards.

Val Kilmer will reprise his role as Tom “Iceman” Kazansky in the sequel. Jon Hamm, Ed Harris, Lewis Pullman, Charles Parnell, Jay Ellis, Bashir Salahuddin, Danny Ramirez, and Monica Barbaro round out the cast.

The original film was a massive success, grossing more than $350 million worldwide on a $15 million budget.

Paramount also announced on Wednesday that it has dated its sequel to the horror pic “A Quiet Place” for May 15, 2020. The sleeper hit, starring John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, has hauled $188 million domestically and $144 million internationally.

Krasinski directed the story of an isolated family of four that must live in silence while hiding from creatures that hunt by sound. He’s working on the script for the sequel.

Former MTV “Road Rules” star Brian Lancaster was just 43 years old when he passed away in Pennsylvania in March. Now, RadarOnline.com has learned the cause of his death.

The Chester County Coroner's Office told the site in a statement, “The cause of death was fentanyl, heroin and ethanol intoxication, with the manner of death being accidental.”

Lancaster had a few arrests over the years related to alcohol and drugs, but his mother Carol told Radar last month that she believed he was sober at the time of his death and had died of heart failure.

-940117,‘Bachelorette’ alum Colton Underwood addresses controversial winner,"Becca Kufrin may not have the full support of #BachelorNation’s fan base, following her engagement to controversial contestant Garrett Yrigoyen on Monday’s finale of “The Bachelorette,” but former love Colton Underwood believes she made the right choice.

“In regards to who Garrett is, and I’m not defending his likes whatsoever, a lot of them were wrong, but that’s not who Garrett is, that does not define Garrett, and it should not overshadow their relationship,” Underwood, 26, told Page Six on Tuesday. “This is a time when they should be celebrating their engagement and being happy.”

After his social media history was unearthed in May, Yrigoyen, 29, issued an apology for double-tapping offensive content on Instagram.

“He’s owned it, he’s apologized for it, he’s made his statement. I think people need to realize that,” Underwood continued. “It’s a mistake, you live and you learn, and Garrett has definitely learned from this.”

Though Kufrin, 28, and Yrigoyen aren’t rushing to the altar, Underwood is hopeful to find a happy ending of his own on this season of “Bachelor in Paradise.”

“I think coming off [‘The Bachelorette’], I realized how cool and fun of an experience that was, it was such a good time of my life to self-discover and grow as a person, and I wanted to continue that and to continue to find love,” he said.

With former flame and “Bachelor” alum Tia Booth in “Paradise,” too, Underwood called the time in Mexico an emotional experience.

“When I say emotional, I not only mean sad, but obviously in the teaser [trailer] where I was crying, but happy, confused, it’s just a lot of emotions that came out. Overall, it was a good learning and growing experience for me.”

The 35-year-old actress spoke about her time filming Ocean’s 8 and addressed rumours that having such an all-star cast resulted in conflicting egos.

When asked by Hoda Kotb what it was really like to work with a roster of female a-listers, Hathaway said: “It’s been really amazing to watch the way certain members of the media have wanted us to fight each other and the way they wanted there to be competition and catfights, but we were all collaborating—all the time.

Julianna Margulies confirms to TVLine that she was invited to bring Alicia Florrick over to the CBS All Access spinoff during the series’ inaugural season, but she wasn’t quite ready to go there.

“I really didn’t want to do it when they asked me in the first season,” she recalls, “because I didn’t think that was fair [to the series or its cast, led by Christine Baranski, Cush Jumbo and Rose Leslie]. I felt like, ‘Get on your own two feet. Do your thing.’ Because if Alicia had come in, in the first season, it would have been [all] about Alicia and The Good Wife. And now it’s their show.”

Margulies, however, does not rule out a future cameo on The Good Fight, which was recently renewed for a third season (to bow in early 2019). Despite harboring “uncomfortable” feelings about “going backwards” in her career, the three-time Emmy winner — who’s currently starring in AMC’s new ultra dark dramedy Dietland — says, “I never say never to anything, because I think that’s silly.”

Case in point: She returned to ER for that show’s final season. “It was one week and [George Clooney and I] had a blast,” Margulies enthuses. “It felt so comfortable to get back into that relationship and those clothes and those lines and let these characters — who were such a part of American culture — come back. So I would never say never because I loved going back to ER.”

Margulies watched the Good Fight pilot and thought it was “magnificent.” But she never made it to Episode 2 or beyond. “I said to [franchise creators] Robert and Michelle [King] recently that it’s hard for me to watch a law show right now, which is how I felt after ER,” she admits. “I couldn’t watch another medical show, because you go right back into [the mechanics of shooting a show like that]. It just takes you out of the show. I’ll binge watch it in a year or two.” (With reporting by Kim Roots)",real

A photo shows Sarofim embracing Lavigne as they share a smooch during the outing. The singer wore a white dress and pink hat, while Sarofim sported a polo shirt, shorts and baseball cap.

The show of PDA comes amid Lavigne's return to the spotlight. She largely retreated from public life after being diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2014.

Lavigne was first linked to Sarofim, the son of Texas businessman Fayez Sarofim, in May. Sources told E! News at the time that the couple were introduced by mutual friends at a dinner party.

-940414,Jennifer Garner Is a Ripped Mom Out for Revenge in Peppermint,"“Vigilante Mom” is turning into a full-blown, though low-budget, action genre right now. There was 2017's Kidnap, in which Halle Berry transforms into a car-chasing vigilante when her child is abducted, and then the recent Breaking In, which has Gabrielle Union out to protect her children from violent intruders. Now Jennifer Garner joins the bloody, ripped mom ranks in Peppermint, a movie where she seeks gruesome revenge for the death of her child.

Garner plays a mom named Riley, whose daughter and husband are gunned down by members linked to the “Garcia cartel.” Gaslighted by corrupt cops and the justice system, who let the murderers off the hook, she disappears and spends five years toning her muscles and training to fight (read: stocking up on a gazillion semi-automatics.) And when the five-year anniversary of her family’s murder comes along, she comes back for revenge.

While I love the idea of Garner starring as a crazed mom out for blood, I’d have to say that something about this movie feels uncomfortably Trumpian (ugh I’m sorry, I’m sorry!!!) The trailer is littered with lines like “well at least somebody’s doing something,” which feels like catnip dialogue for people who go crazy over their right to bear arms. Do we really need a revenge thriller that overly exaggerates Latino gangs shooting down innocent white people right now?

“What do I want?” Riley says in the trailer. “I want justice.” I think if I shoo away all the weird political implications of a movie like this, at the end of the day, that’s all I want for Jennifer Garner, too.

Bridges plays one of seven strangers who meet at the El Royale over the course of a single night, including a shirtless Chris Hemsworth, a gun-toting gangster played by Dakota Johnson, Cynthia Erivo’s singer, and a vacuum cleaner salesman portrayed by Jon Hamm. Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, and Nick Offerman also star, with Drew Goddard directing from his own script. Goddard also produced “Bad Times.”

Bridges is warned by the clerk, “This is not a place for a priest, father,” and admits later in the trailer, “Can I confess something to you? I’m not really a priest.”

It’s not quite clear from the trailer why the characters have come to the El Royale and the studio’s description of the plot is somewhat obscure: “Seven strangers, each with a secret to bury, meet at Lake Tahoe’s El Royale, a run-down hotel with a dark past. Over the course of one fateful night, everyone will have a last shot at redemption … before everything goes to hell.”

Bridges received his seventh Oscar nomination last year for “Hell or High Water.” Goddard received an Academy Award nom in 2016 for best adapted screenplay for “The Martian” and directed Hemsworth in 2012’s “The Cabin in the Woods” from a script he co-wrote with Joss Whedon.

“There was a point in my life, right before Big Little Lies, where I had hit a wall with acting,” she told Porter Edit. “I felt it was time to do something different. I called my agents and said, ‘Please don’t send me any more scripts; I need to explore other avenues.'”

“They respected me and didn’t send me anything for almost a year until Big Little Lies,” Woodley said. “I didn’t know what it was or who was involved, I just said, ‘Thanks, I’m still not interested.'”

Her refusal to read the script might have ended things before they began, but her agents insisted she read it before she said no, telling her Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern were involved.

Anyone who has flown while pregnant knows that travel has its own set of particular annoyances and complications when ""you're knocked up,"" as Danes put it live on air, and even Emmy award-winning actors aren't immune.

Danes began the interview by explaining that, in order to encourage blood flow to her heart, she's supposed to wear compression stockings (also referred to as ""compression socks"") as often as possible. But she avoids them unless she's traveling because she thinks they're ""dreadful.""

On her flight to L.A., she delayed putting the stockings on until it was ""entirely essential,"" which meant trying to squeeze into the extra tight stockings in the ""teeny, tiny bathroom of the plane,"" which resulted in a battle of life and limb that took upwards of ""20 freakin' minutes"" to get through.

As Danes pointed out in her lesson learned, ""it turns out compression stockings are rather tight"" and she may have been wise to have followed her doctor's suggestion to use talcum powder to help with the process. Thankfully, all turned out well and the Homeland actress now has a funny story that other moms will surely relate to. ""I don't know what they thought I was doing in there,"" said Danes at the end of the story, ""but it was not erotic.""

Danes was likely referring to the risk for developing blood clots called deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is why some people wear compression socks while traveling

I’m fuckin’ hungry.”

I was taught to do my makeup by queens in gay bars in New York City. I made my Broadway debut at 14 years old and did 8 shows a week but there was never a night I was too tired to run to a gay bar and do a quick Whitney cover before bed.

My music being embraced and celebrated by the LGBTQ community is all I ever truly cared about when I thought about my career goals early on. There’s no award I could win or accolade I could receive that would fulfill me more than seeing a 6-foot queen with a 4-foot ponytail walk into my meet n greet and say “hey girl” or meeting a young queer person at Starbucks and them letting me know that my music has helped them become who they are. Literally nothing.

Love is like music. It knows no boundaries and isn’t exclusive to any one gender, sexuality, race, religion, age or creed. It’s a freedom and a delicious luxury that all people should be able to sink into and enjoy every moment of.

I am eternally indebted to and inspired by the LGBTQ community. I hope to create anthems for you that wrap you up with comfort and make you get your best life for as long as I live. Thank you for celebrating me the way I celebrate you.

I love you forever.",real

""Hundreds of thousands of children that are ready to be your child. You're a forever parent the minute you accept the love of that child,"" Bullock told Kotb.

""It's amazing to me how we can take away people's happiness by telling them, 'This is the box you have to stay in,'"" she said of starting a family. ""There is no box.""

-940752,Justin Theroux Is Now Apparently “Bffffffs” with Emma Stone and Queer Eye’s Jonathan Van Ness,"Concept: a Queer Eye spinoff featuring current Fab Five grooming expert Jonathan Van Ness, Academy Award winner Emma Stone, and leather jacket-loving, actor-producer-screenwriter Justin Theroux. It might sound far-fetched, but, according to a recent Instagram post, the trio are already “Bffffffs” and, no doubt, are looking for a way to take their friendship to the next level. On Monday, Theroux posted the photo of the three to his Instagram Story. Though it has since disappeared, the instantly iconic pic was screen-shotted and reposted by several quick-thinking Emma Stone fan pages.

In the shot, the three stars strike matching poses, chins resting on hands, and exhibit a variety of facial expressions: Van Ness serves deer-in-headlights realness, while Stone breaks into a serene smile, and Theroux offers up a mysterious smolder. “Save lives! Save lives! Saving lives! Doing the most!” Theroux captioned the photo, referencing Van Ness’s tidy firefighter job description in the first season of Netflix’s Queer Eye reboot. “Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs,” Theroux added, though that’s unlikely to stop fans from eagerly hoping for a Justin-Jonathan romance. Though Theroux didn’t note where exactly the meet-up took place, it may have been at a Netflix-related event, since the streaming powerhouse just renewed Queer Eye for a second season, and Theroux and Stone recently signed on to star in the platform’s upcoming series Maniac.

Since he and Jennifer Aniston announced earlier this year that they were separating after two years of marriage, Theroux has been spending time with many of his closest “bfffffs,” according to People. On Sunday, he was spotted walking through New York City with Paul Rudd and Rudd’s wife, Julie Yaeger. And just last week, he took another walk through the city with Aubrey Plaza; amid romance rumors, a source told the outlet that the pals had only met up “to discuss a potential film project.”",real

Jenner and Carter’s wedding took place on the exotic island of Nihi Sumba in Indonesia. The oceanside ceremony was joined by 50 of the bride and groom’s family and friends, according to People.

The couple exchanged their wedding vows in front of Jenner’s brother Brandon and mother Linda Thompson. Meanwhile, the “I Am Cait” star wasn’t able to attend her son’s big day because she chose to fly to Vienna, Austria to attend the Life Ball fundraising event.

Jenner and Carter’s wedding was the culmination of the four-day festivities on the island, which included horse races on the beach and a white party where the couple and their guests danced the night away.

“We’re just excited to celebrate spending the rest of our lives together,” Jenner said days prior the ceremony. “I can’t wait to marry Kaitlynn.”

It wasn’t clear how much Jenner spent for the four-day affair, but Page Six has learned that he is shelling out $6,000 per night on the suite where he and Carter are spending their honeymoon.

Jenner and Carter originally had invited 70 guests, but not everyone was able to attend. Aside from Jenner’s father, his half-sisters with Kris Jenner, Kendall and Kylie, also did not make it to the tropical wedding.

Kylie was said to be busy taking care of baby True, so she chose not to come. On the other hand, Kendall’s reason for ditching the family event was not disclosed.

“My two little sisters, we never even heard from them. They never even RSVP’d I don’t think,” the former “The Hills” star said days before the nuptials. “We sent them an invite but we just never heard anything back. Well, they’ll be missed. I would have loved to have had them there.”

Because some important people weren’t able to fly to Indonesia, a source dished to Us Weekly that Jenner and Carter are planning to host a second wedding celebration when they get back to Los Angeles after their honeymoon.

The pair will host the CMA Awards for the 11th year in a row, the Country Music Association announced Thursday.

The superstars will take their spots on stage Wednesday, Nov. 14 in Nashville for country music’s biggest night, airing at 8 p.m. on ABC.

Paisley, 45, and Underwood, 35, are known for the humor they bring to the show, and this year’s 52nd CMA Awards will likely be no different. Before the 2017 show, the two discussed their approach to making jokes in such a tense year for politics and culture.

“We just want to make fun of things that are funny,” Underwood, told PEOPLE at the time. “We’ve always tried to keep that in our minds, but this year more than ever … I hope that people don’t take clips and things out of context — that’s the most frustrating part, I think.”

-941159,A ‘9 to 5’ Reunion? Dolly Parton May Stop by ‘Grace & Frankie’ Amid Netflix Deal,"Netflix’s beloved buddy comedy Grace and Frankie already stars two beloved icons, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. But this duo may become a trio soon!

This week, it was teased that Dolly Parton could stop by for a guest role in the coming season. Parton, Fonda, and Tomlin headlined the iconic workplace comedy 9 to 5 in 1980, and fans have been dying for a reunion ever since — something they got a taste of when the three presented together at the 2017 Emmys. During a For Your Consideration event, the Grace and Frankie cast spoke about their hopes for the country legend to stop by.

When first asked about Parton joining the show, Grace and Frankie creators Marta Kauffman and Howard J. Morris voiced their support for a Parton appearance, according to Deadline,but claimed scheduling was to blame for her lack of presence in prior seasons. Tomlin added that it may be difficult as Parton has her own deal with Netflix in the works.

Details on Parton’s deal were made public on Monday, as the streaming service shared that it has partnered with the multi-hyphenate on an eight-part anthology series. The episodes would be based on Parton’s songs with each installment covering a song a piece.

Much like her NBC films, Coat of Many Colors and Coat of Many Colors: Circle of Love, Parton’s Netflix project will see her take on the role of executive producer, singer-songwriter, and she will act in the series.

The country star made a statement, “As a songwriter, I have always enjoyed telling stories through my music. I am thrilled to be bringing some of my favorite songs to life with Netflix. We hope our show will inspire and entertain families and folks of all generations, and I want to thank the good folks at Netflix and Warner Bros. TV for their incredible support.”

From the sounds of it, Parton isn’t likely to show up in Season 5 either, but with the popularity of the show, if a sixth season is in the cards, could we see that 9 to 5 reunion? We sure hope so.

Jordan Wanted to Only Audition for Roles Written for White Men,"During their interview for Variety‘s “Actors on Actors,” presented by Shutterstock, “Fahrenheit 451” star Michael B. Jordan told “Insecure’s” Issa Rae that after he finished working on “Fruitvale Station,” he told his agents that he didn’t want to audition for roles written for African-Americans.

“I said, I don’t want it. I want to only go for, like, [roles written for] white males. That’s it,” he said. “Me playing that role is going to make it what it is. I don’t want any pre-bias on the character.”

Rae also opened up about the positive change that seems to be overtaking Hollywood’s perception of what a leading actress looks like following the success of movies like “Black Panther.” She that said early on in her career, her agents would send roles to her that Rae doubted she’d be able to land because of her race.

“If it were a leading woman of a certain type, I just knew the type that they would go for, so I’m just not going to even bother,” Rae said. “People have been receptive. Even just the confidence that a movie like [“Black Panther”] and other films by other filmmakers of color that have come out have really just changed what people perceive as a leading lady, as the beautiful person, the daring or the bold action-adventure type. That just feels so dope to me.”

The former Dance Moms star, who was preliminarily diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, revealed on Instagram Tuesday evening that she underwent a procedure and is now on the mend.

“After another 2 hour MRI this morning, the pros thought I needed one more quick little emergency surgery! Ugh!” she began.

“I’m in recovery now and texting so everything must be ok, just hiccups in my plans!” continued Miller, who recently began her third round of chemotherapy.



Miller also shared, “I’m on a tight schedule; shooting two projects and I need to get out of here and on with my life!!!” and asked that fans “Please keep me in your prayers🙏🏻.”

“I’m grateful for all the well wishes!” she concluded.

In April, one day after undergoing emergency surgery for what was initially thought to be a spinal infection, the 51-year-old — newly released from prison — was preliminarily diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a cancer that develops in the lymphatic system.

“We’re getting an oncologist involved and we have to figure out what the next steps are as far as chemotherapy or radiation or more spine surgery.

-941924,Beyonce and JAY-Z Show Off Twins in Epic 'On the Run II' Concert Footage,"Are we finally getting a look Beyonce and JAY-Z's adorable twins?

It's been almost a year since the couple welcomed daughter Rumi and son Sir, and they may have finally shared new pics of their bundles of joy during their On the Run II tour kickoff in Cardiff, Wales, on Wednesday.

Fans quickly took to social media to share pics of the screens at the beginning of the concert, which show the proud parents cradling two babies. In one pic, Beyonce wears her hair in braids and dons a cream dress while, on the opposite side of the stage, her rapper husband is in the same pose. In between the two are the phrases, ""Love Is Universal"" and ""Love Never Changes.""

But just as fans were getting worked up, ET learned that the babies in question were not actually Rumi and Sir.

However, later on in the show, the real Carter twins appeared along with Blue Ivy during what appears to be an intimate vow renewal ceremony.

Beyonce's mother, who is also seen in the holding Rumi in the footage, confirmed these were in fact the real twins when she shared the pic on Instagram along with the caption, ""My babies.""

A source exclusively tells ET that the couple wants their tour to be a ""family affair.""

""Beyonce and JAY Z want to let fans into their lives on their own terms,"" the source says. ""They start the show as a united front, entering together from above the stage. This is symbolic of the couple working through their previous issues and sticking together.""

""Beyonce and JAY Z worked really hard on this tour making it an over the top experience for their fans,"" the source continues. ""The stage is bigger than ever, the performances are over the top and they will be showing numerous family photos and videos of the couple. The three kids will be traveling with mom and dad when they can. Beyonce and JAY Z don't like to be away from the kids for too long.""

The last time the couple shared images of Sir and Rumi was when they turned one month on July 13, 2017, and the singer posted the epic picture of her cradling them on Instagram.

Meanwhile, ET recently caught up with the On the Run II opening act, Chloe x Halle, who teased an ""incredibly epic"" tour.

-941894,Teen takes Danny DeVito cutout to prom and he responds perfectly,"A Danny DeVito superfan has got his attention – after she took a cardboard cutout of him as her prom date.

Pennsylvania student Allison Closs couldn’t find a living, breathing date for her dance, so she decided to order one online.

In a YouTube post about it, she said:

I couldn’t find myself a date in real life or with an actual human. So I bought one on Amazon. I have always loved Danny. I loved him on It’s Always Sunny in Philedelphia, I loved him in Hercules and Matilda. I just love him in every form he takes. Danny was there for me when I really needed him. He treats me the way a woman should be treated.

In the video, she ‘interviewed’ her dad, who told her that though he’s a “little bit older…”

He’s a very nice man and I think he’s going to treat [his daughter] with a lot of respect.

The initial video went viral and people viewed it thousands of times.

Closs’ photo with cardboard DeVito was shared widely online – it was even upvoted more than 100,000 times on Reddit.

In fact, it spread far and wide – and waltzed right onto Danny DeVito’s radar.

The veteran actor’s It’s Always Sunny co-star Rob McElhenney spotted her picture and DeVito felt compelled to respond in kind:

I heard you took cardboard Danny to Prom. What a coincidence. He took cardboard Allison to Paddy's [the pub in It's Always Sunny].

Slide for IRL Danny >>>

And when Closs found out about DeVito's homage to her, well, the wonderful story came full circle.

The internet is a great thing, sometimes.

Of course she's just joking as they did when they were posting Instagrams regularly and commenting on the other's every photo in the summer. The two chose to take a social media break in late July because of the negative comments the couple was receiving.

Davidson didn't only post on his page yesterday, either. On Grande's page, Davidson liked her two most recent Instagrams and posted his own comment on her latest photo of herself. He made it clear then that his return to the platform was very temporary and hey, belated like to all the photos Grande posted that he missed. ""Hot. All the ones you posted with me not online are hot. Love ya. Bye for another 3 months,"" he wrote.

Grande had this response to Davidson, naturally: ""Good thing ur sitting next to me and I see u every second and nothing important happens online that I don't show u anyway. Bye. Ily.""",real
-941895,Rita Ora kisses Cardi B in the new video for controversial track ‘Girls’,"Rita Ora has released a video for her controversial track ‘Girls’.

The song – which also features Cardi B, Charli XCX and Bebe Rexha – was released last month. It quickly faced backlash from the LGBTQ+ community, with pop singer Hayley Kiyoko and R&B artist Kehlani criticising the track for being “downright tone-deaf.”

Kiyoko later released a statement claiming that the song “does more harm than good for the LGBTQ+ community” and Kehlani hit out at the song for its “harmful lyrics”.

A video for the track has been released and features a hologram of Cardi B kissing Ora. You can watch it below.

Ora previously apologised for any offense caused, stating: “‘Girls’ was written to represent my truth and is an accurate account of a very real and honest experience in my life. I have had romantic relationships with women and men throughout my life and this is my personal journey.

“I am sorry how I expressed myself in my song has hurt anyone,” she continued on Twitter. “I would never intentionally cause harm to other LGBTQ+ people or anyone. Looking forward, I hope that continuing to express myself through my art will empower my fans to feel as proud of themselves as I’m learning to feel about who I am.”

She added she is “ever thankful” to her fans for teaching her to “love myself no matter what”. “I have strived to be a contributor to the LGBTQ+ community throughout my entire career and always will be,” she finished.

I though the song was a good song and i remember my experience .”

So it's no surprise that he's also good at hosting late night television and slaying James Corden in a cover battle contest.

Shawn has been hanging out with James on The Late Late Show this past week; call it a takeover, call it guest-hosting, call it whatever you want — but we’re calling it our new favorite TV show. The latest shenanigans Shawn and James got into was a cover battle, where they competed in a subway station (AKA a set dressed up to look like they were singing in the subway) to see who could do the most epic cover. Shawn took on Oasis’s “Wonderwall,” while James whipped out a literal piano and sparkly jacket to do “Great Balls of Fire,” which definitely raised the stakes for Shawn.

Not to be outdone, Shawn transformed himself into “DJ Stitches,” a nod to his first big hit, and blasted “We Found Love” by Rihanna, complete with a light machine and sunglasses. James then masqueraded as all five Backstreet Boys by wearing puppets in white suits to perform “Everybody.” Their turf war finally ended when Shawn came down from the ceiling in a literal angel outfit to sing his own song, “There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back,” alongside a gospel choir. You don’t see that in a subway station every day, do you? In our opinion, DJ Stitches definitely won the cover battle.

Shawn and James shared more of their favorite music in an episode of Carpool Karaoke recently too. They sang some of Shawn’s biggest hits, like “Treat You Better” and “Mercy,” and Shawn even dressed up like Harry Potter to discuss his super-fandom of the book series. This week-long takeover of the Late Late Show has us thinking that Shawn could definitely have a career as a talk show host.",real

USA TODAY

Prince fans are getting a special present to commemorate what would have been the singer's 60th birthday on June 7, 2018.

The Prince estate and Warner Bros. announced on Thursday that a new album of the artist's material, Piano & a Microphone 1983, will be released on Sept. 21.

The nine-track, 35-minute album features previously unreleased material of Prince at his piano in his home studio in Chanhassen, Minn., recorded in 1983. The track list offers early versions of songs including Purple Rain, 17 Days and Strange Relationship; a cover of Joni Mitchell’s A Case Of You; and the singer's take on the 19th-century spiritual Mary Don’t You Weep, which will be featured during the end credits of Spike Lee’s forthcoming movie BlacKkKlansman, in theaters this August.

The cover art for Piano & a Microphone 1983 features a rare photo of Prince backstage during the 1999 tour taken by the singer's former photographer and creative collaborator, Allen Beaulieu.

Prince was 57 when he was found dead at his Paisley Park estate on April 21, 2016.",real
-941952,Fuse,"This June will mark the 49th year since the Stonewall Riots, a watershed moment in the modern-day LGBTQ rights movement and creating the Pride Month we know today. Yet it wasn't until more than three decades afterwards that a United States president would declare June as a month of pride and commemoration for LGBTQ people in the country. And before we move forward with our celebration, it's important to understand how we got here.

While the Stonewall Riots are mostly considered the pivotal moment in creating LGBTQ pride, major actions for visibility and equal rights were taking place beforehand in the 1950s and 1960s. Early demonstrations were done by the Mattachine Society, which focused on civil and political rights of gay men, and the Daughters of Bilitis, a lesbian rights group, with both carrying out Philadelphia's ""Annual Reminders"" which saw picketers reminding Americans that LGBTQ people did not receive basic civil rights. In response to the police raid at Greenwich Village's Stonewall Inn, now known as the Stonewall Riots, the queer community and its supporters decided they would meet in June in New York City to march and remember the incident. Originally called Christopher Street Liberation Day, the demonstration took place on June 28, 1970, with similar demonstrations spreading annually around the country and world. In 2000, President Bill Clinton declared June as ""Gay & Lesbian Pride Month"" and the month has gone unrecognized except for President Barack Obama later declaring the month as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month every year of his presidency.

While the history is certainly a part of the celebration, here at Fuse we're using the next 30 days to look forward. We're celebrating Future LGBTQ History. Each day during the month of June, we'll spotlight the future of LGBTQ history by showcasing the world's most talented, creative and influential people on the rise. Some are young and at the start of their takeover; others are already commanding the world's attention. What brings these people together is the promise of inspiring change for years to come.",real

Kim Kardashian says it’s okay to cheat… on your diet!

On Thursday, the KUWTK star published a blog post on her website where she reveals her cheat plan strategy.

Related: Kim & Khlo├â┬⌐ Kardashian Share Parenting Tips!

Although Kanye West‘s wife normally eats really clean, she understands the importance of satisfying your cravings!

According to the social media queen:

“I’ve been really strict with my diet, recently… When I grocery shop, I buy lean protein, carbs, fruits and veggies, but every once in a while, I like to treat myself and have a cheat meal. It can be so hard (and boring) to eat really clean all of the time. A cheat meal allows me to enjoy food without feeling like I’m overindulging. My trainer, Mel, instructs that you should schedule a cheat meal about once every 10 days. This way you won’t lose any of the progress you’ve made at the gym.”

Kimmy recommends that you indulge WITHOUT booze, and to do so infrequently. However, the day after you treat yourself, you MUST “get back on track.”

“When you do them too often, your body’s hormones are thrown off… Your testosterone, which is a muscle-making and fat-loss hormone, can change if you’re eating too many calories, which can make you gain weight. You can still enjoy your favorite food, as long as you get back on track the next day. Cheat meals work best when you avoid alcohol, since they’re empty calories filled with sugar. This part is easy for me since I don’t really drink├óΓé¼ΓÇ¥which means I can just have an extra doughnut or two. Kidding! I do have a sweet tooth, though, so normally my cheat meals are desserts or other sweets.”

Judging from her appearance, the 37-year-old clearly knows what she’s talking about!

In February of this year, the mother-of-three revealed she has a 24-inch waist and 39-inch hips.

Kim, whatever you’re doing, keep it up!

Cardi B has taken over the music industry with her hits such as ""Bodak Yellow"" and ""I Like It"", but the mom-to-be is also taking over Instagram. The rapper recently shared a photo of herself onto her Instagram account showing off her baby bump and a new ‘do. Cardi B announced her pregnancy earlier this year on Saturday Night Live, where she performed as the show's guest performer and revealed her bump for the first time in a stunning white dress.

Rumors regarding the rappers pregnancy with Migos’ Offset swirled for months until Cardi herself wanted to be “free” and finally put an end to all that baby talk. With the cat out of the bag and a bun in the oven, Cardi is sharing her journey through pregnancy with her fans online, including in her most recent post.

She did take a brief Instagram hiatus earlier this year in May, after an altercation with Azealia Banks, but it is clear that she is back and ready to flaunt her stuff on the social media platform.

The ""Be Careful"" rapper captioned her photo: “Big Momma”, as she posed looking absolutely beautiful in a white body fitting dress, with ornate jewelry, long pink nails, and her new rainbow hair. Yes, you heard that right, rainbow hair. Cardi wore her hair in a half-up-half-down top-knot style to show off her rainbow colors. The blue, pink and yellow colors radiate in the pic, being the center of attention in the gorgeous shot.

The rapper is proving that although she may be pregnant, it is by no means putting a stop her creative fashion choices. Cardi has been a huge supporter of Fashionova, an online retailer that sells clothes for less, and it appears that she has smashed it yet again in this Instagram pic. If anyone can make rainbow hair work, it’s definitely Cardi B.

The rapper is not only expecting any day now, she is currently promoting her recent album Invasion of Privacy, which was released on April 6th, 2018. With a baby on the way, an album to promote and a strong Instagram game, Cardi is proving that she can truly do it all.

-942825,Ripped: Teresa Giudice Reveals New Form at her First Bodybuilding Competition,"She's a reality star, a cookbook author and....a bodybuilder?

Teresa Giudice showed off her rock-hard form when she competed in the Bikini Division of the NPC South Jersey Bodybuilding Championships on Saturday at Shawnee High School in Medford, New Jersey. This is her first-ever bodybuilding competition.

The mom of four flashed her toned and tanned flesh in a purple halter bikini.

The ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"" star has kept quiet on her social media about the competition. She's been dedicated to posting on Instagram about her fitness journey recently, but has posted nothing about the competition.

Stars Who Feuded With Real Housewives

Several RHONJ castmembers, including Melissa Gorga and Joe Gorga and Dolores and Frank Catania, cheered her on during the competition, which is reportedly being filmed for an upcoming episode of her Bravo show, reports Us Weekly.

Following her 11-month stint in prison back in 2015, Giudice has been dedicated to her health.

Giudice went to prison after she and her husband, Joe Giudice, pleaded guilty to multiple counts of bankruptcy fraud in 2014. On March 23, 2016, Joe began serving his 41-month sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey.",real

-942801,Rosie O'Donnell Says She's 'Reconnected' With Pregnant Daughter Chelsea,"Rosie O'Donnell and her estranged daughter, Chelsea Alliegro, are making amends.

A rep for the 56-year-old former The View co-host tells ET that O'Donnell and her 20-year-old daughter have ""reconnected.""

“Rosie said, yes, she’s pregnant and they reconnected,” the rep stated. People was first to report the news.

Alliegro revealed that she was pregnant in an interview with Daily Mail in September of last year, but at the time said she didn’t want O'Donnell to be a part of her baby's life. The expecting mother, who was reported missing by O'Donnell in 2015 (she was later found at the house of another man), said she and O'Donnell didn't ""have a relationship anymore"" and she didn't think ""it [could] be mended.""

""I've always wanted a family and I'm looking forward to it. But Rosie will not be in my child's life -- and no, I do not feel sad about that to be honest,"" Alliegro said. Both O'Donnell and her daughter have been vocal about their tumultuous relationship.

Following Alliegro's comments, O'Donnell responded by taking to Twitter and writing, ""She's 20...not a teen...she is married and pregnant...she doesn't want anything to do with me...great stop...doing interviews go live ur life. We have been here before Chelsea...u wanna go a few rounds in public...seems so...Michelle's death = money 4 Chelsea.""

In another interview with Inside Edition last year, Alliegro recalled how the last time she and O'Donnell got in an argument, ""We ended up screaming at each other and I left the room.”

“Growing up, I never really got along with her and then once she kicked me out, I was just kind of done,” she added.

""She shows me every day that each one of us has the ability to help make the world a better place. I'm the luckiest man ever. She said yes!"" he shared on Twitter Tuesday morning.

Key, 46, and Pugliese have kept their romance largely out of the public eye, though the two have attended events together, including the U.S. Open this year and the Rescue Dinner hosted by IRC in New York City earlier this month.

-942960,Robert De Niro gets censored for saying 'F— Trump' at Tony Awards,"You talking to me?

De Niro was talking to Tony viewers Sunday evening during the broadcast of the 72nd annual Tony Awards when a chunk of his speech was censored.

Before De Niro introduced a performance from Bruce Springsteen, television screens went silent and viewers were left wondering what was going on. Fortunately, audience members inside the house clarified over Twitter, reporting that De Niro said, “I’m going to say this — F— TRUMP. It’s no longer ‘Down with Trump,’ it’s F— TRUMP.”

After the thunderous applause died down, De Niro continued, “Now I’ll get to this introduction… Bruce, you can rock the house like nobody else and even more important in these perilous times, you rock the vote always fighting for truth, transparency, and integrity in government. Boy, do we need that now.”

De Niro has made no bones about his opposition to Donald Trump and his administration, having previously gone on a profanity-laced tirade against the president at the National Board of Review awards gala. The actor also popped up several times on Saturday Night Live this past season playing Robert Mueller, the lead investigator in a case looking into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.

The Academy Award-winning actor also joked that the difficulty of getting a ticket to Springsteen’s Broadway show was why he had agreed to present at the Tony Awards. De Niro said, “Do you have any idea how hard it is to get tickets for Bruce Springsteen’s show on Broadway? It’s easier to get tickets for Hamilton.”

Springsteen then went on to deliver a soulful rendition of “My Hometown” along with an excerpt from the monologuing text of his one-man show. Earlier in the evening, Billy Joel presented him with his Special Tony Award.

-942951,Rachel Brosnahan attends Tony Awards days after aunt Kate Spade’s death,"Rachel Brosnahan returned to the red carpet for the Tony Awards on Sunday, June 10, days after her aunt Kate Spade died at the age of 55.

The Marvelous Miss Maisel actress, 27, stepped out in a pink floral Dolce & Gabbana gown for the star-studded event at Radio City Music Hall in NYC. After posing for photos, she’d later introduce the performance of The Band’s Visit.

Spade died by suicide on June 5. She was found dead in her New York City apartment at about 10:20 a.m. by her housekeeper. Brosnahan’s father is the brother of the late designer.

Spade’s husband, Andy Spade, broke his silence following the news on June 6. “Kate was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was the kindest person I’ve ever known and my best friend for 35 years. My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her. We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already,” he said in a statement. “Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many. She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy.”

He continued: “There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn’t her. There were personal demons she was battling.”

The pair, who married in 1994, are the parents of daughter Frances Beatrix, now 13. They were separated at the time of Kate’s death.

Like Brosnahan, Andy’s brother David Spade has returned to the public eye since the tragedy. On June 8, he said during a stand-up performance that it had been a “rough week” but he didn’t want to cancel the show.",real

The duo could apparently relate, too. ""We are your hosts / And we're perfectly suited to be / Because did you know / Neither one of us has never won anything,"" they sang in unison.

Groban quickly interrupted the song, asking Bareilles, ""That can't be right, Sara, no Grammys for you?""

""Well you know, it is what it is,"" Groban said.

Despite never winning, both hosts have earned Grammy and Tony nominations.

The family event comes after a series of fun outings for the good-looking pair, who were first linked after attending the 2017 Met Gala together.

In May, the two enjoyed an epic Memorial Day weekend together featuring a string of Bachelor-worthy dates, including a night at the Beauty and the Beast Live in Concert, a visit to a Dodgers game and a day on a boat with pals.

Lady Gaga. Picture: Instagram Lady Gaga wants people to speak up about their mental health, because she believes “secrets keep you sick”. The 32-year-old musician has admitted that whilst she “struggled” for a long while when it came to speaking publicly about her struggles with mental health, she admits she felt better once she had someone to confide in, and says keeping her battle to herself only made her problems worse. She said: ""I have struggled for a long time, both being public and not public about my mental health issues or my mental illness. But, I truly believe that secrets keep you sick.” Gaga spoke as she honoured her mother Cynthia Germanotta, with the Global Changemakers Award at Children Mending Hearts' Empathy Rocks fundraiser over the weekend, and said that whilst she realises it’s “safer” for her to speak out now that she’s a star, she hopes her work with the charity will help other people come forward too. She added: “I realise that it's actually safer to say how I feel. What Children Mending Hearts is doing today rocks because it's safer for others who feel like me.”

The ‘Million Reasons’ singer also highlighted the importance of having “real honest conversations” about mental health, and urged everyone to put more “kindness” into the world.

She said: ""We bring people together to have real, honest conversations and to be kind. Kindness is not an afterthought to our work. It is the driving power for everything we do. It is the lens we view every challenge through. It is framing the way we put everything around every possible solution. To me, almost every problem you can think of can be solved with kindness. At least it could be made better. Kindness has a soft undertone. Sometimes people think it is weak. It is tremendously powerful. It can change the way that we view each other. The way that we view our communities and the way that we work. Even the way that we feel about ourselves, by being kinder to ourselves. We need more kindness in the world.""

Both of their ensembles are pure spandex – down to their Yeezy sock boots. To take their kloning moment to the next level, Kim and Kylie also accessorized with Starbucks drinks and large, mirrored sunglasses. The size of the frames was surprising, considering the Kardashian-Jenner fam's affinity for tiny, Matrix-like sunglasses.

Later that same day, Kim wore yet another tight-fitting outfit, this time a bright red ensemble that consisted of what looks like bike shorts, a top, and silver leggings (or it's a unitard/catsuit – who even knows?), which she paired with the same sunnies and sock boots as before, as well as a tiny blue bag around her neck.

Honestly, these outings seem very similar to the staged paparazzi photos that Kim took part in last year to debut Kanye's Season 6 collection, in which she ran multiple ""errands"" in full Yeezy looks. Can it be a coincidence that Kim and Kylie wore Yeezy outfits and just *happened* to be photographed together with their Starbucks orders? Or that Kim wore two all-Yeezy spandex looks in one day?

-943664,Wonder Woman 1984 First Look: How Is Steve Trevor Alive?,"Praise Themyscira, for new details about the Wonder Woman sequel are finally being released. On Wednesday, director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot both released stills from the upcoming movie, which will be titled, drum roll . . . Wonder Woman 1984, because the film is set during the Cold War. We’ll get to that in a minute. But first, let’s address the biggest reveal from these new stills: Steve Trevor is alive!

Jenkins shared a still of Chris Pine reprising his role as Trevor with this caption: “Welcome to WONDER WOMAN 1984, Steve Trevor! #WW84.” Let it be known that Pine is absolutely working the hell out of that 1980s-inspired wardrobe, wearing an all-black jumpsuit and a pair of worn-in Nike Cortez sneakers. We’ve also got to give it up to the perfectly dressed extras around him, bringing a full 80s mall fantasy to life. Armie Hammer is going to take one look at this still and un-retire his jumpsuit phase.

X content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

But now for a more pressing question: how, exactly, is Steve Trevor alive? As you might recall, the first Wonder Woman introduced Trevor as an American spy who teams up with Diana during the first World War. They fall in love, but then Trevor rides off on a heroic suicide mission, sacrificing his life in order to prevent a deadly gas from being used in the war. Considering how popular his character was, Warner Bros. brass probably decided Trevor was too handsome and pure to leave behind for the sequel—implausible though his survival may be.

There are numerous ways Trevor could be brought back for the sequel, per the limitless rules of the comic-book world. Trevor could return as an alternate version of himself—maybe from another dimension?—or maybe he was saved from his original fate through a time jump, as comicbook.com surmises. And as The Hollywood Reporter notes, there are already inconsistencies with Trevor’s timeline in the Wonder Woman comics, due to sporadic relaunches and reboots of the franchise—so there are plenty of possible story lines for Jenkins to borrow for the sequel.

Gadot’s Wonder Woman 1984 reveal, meanwhile, was a bit on the simpler side: just a still of Diana Prince standing in front of an ominous number of TV screens.",real

Last month, Parks and Recreation stars Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman floated the idea of bringing back the Emmy-nominated sitcom, which ran for seven seasons between 2009 and 2015, à la Will & Grace, Fuller House, and Canceledanne.

Chris Pratt, Jezebel’s canon fourth-tier famous Chris, was asked about his interest in doing said hypothetical revival while on the red carpet for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’s L.A. premiere Wednesday night. He said he’d “love” to, if he’s around.

“As long as I’m in town, yeah, I’ll do it,” he told E! News reporter Will Marfuggi. “It films, like, 10 minutes from my house, so that would be dope. I mean, you can’t do Parks and Rec without Andy.”

“I miss Andy,” he said. “I would love it. I know I would do it.”

And there you have it, the answer to all (one) of your (my) questions. Chris Pratt would participate in a Parks and Recreation revival.",real
-944175,Jason Mraz Pens Touching 'I Am Bi Your Side' Love Poem to LGBTQ Fans,"Musicians, actors and numerous other pop culture luminaries continue to celebrate Pride Month in their own special way.

Jason Mraz, in particular, penned a touching love poem titled ""I Am Bi Your Side,"" published by Billboard for its ""Love Letter to the LGBTQ Community"" features on Thursday.

""Dear You,

Thank you.

You have inspired me.

Re-wired me.

You showed me what strength is.

You demonstrated courage over and over again.

You risked so much for love.

You never compromised your expression

Even when

Your rights and freedoms were being compromised.

You stood up for me.

You stood up for the world.

And now the world is better because of you.

We still have a long way to go

But know

I am bi your side.

All ways.

Jason Mraz""

The ""Love Someone"" crooner has always been a LGBTQ activist. During his first engagement to Tristan Prettyman in 2011 (they later broke it off six months later), the then-couple vowed to not tie the knot until gay marriage became legal. He was also the first-ever straight man on the cover of Instinct magazine in 2012, recognized for his efforts in support of LGBTQ rights.

The singer eventually went on to marry his girlfriend, Christina Carano, in October 2015, once same-sex marriage became legal in the U.S.

On Thursday, the Waitress actor also released his new single, ""Unlonely,"" which will be featured on his upcoming album, Know, set to be released on Aug.10.

Last year, Maksim Chmerkovskiy married fellow ""Dancing with the Stars"" pro Peta Murgatroyd.

Thursday, his brother, Valentin Chmerkovskiy, and his girlfriend and ""DWTS"" colleague, Jenna Johnson, announced their engagement.

In a simple, straightforward tweet from Venice, Italy, Johnson wrote: ""#ENGAGED @iamValC,"" which is Chmerkovskiy's Twitter handle.

But it's the two accompanying pictures that really stir the emotions.

In the first one, a shocked Johnson stands with her hands over her mouth as Chmerkovskiy kneels to propose, his hand extended while holding a ring. We can figure out her answer even without the tweet's text in the next photo, as Johnson leans down to kiss her brand new fiance.

Chmerkovskiy shared his sentiments in another tweet: ""I can't wait to make you my wife.""

Pattinson added that he couldn't even pick a favorite memory from filming because the entire experiences was so totally formative.

The ring, which was designed by Val and Jacob Arabo of Jacob & Co., is made up of a seemingly large rectangular cushion-cut diamond with a diamond halo and a pavé diamond band.

“Val came to us once he knew he was ready to pop the question and we walked him through the process and helped him design an incredible engagement ring for Jenna,” a representative from the brand tells PEOPLE, adding that the entire process took a month.

As for his decision to propose in the Italian city, Chmerkovskiy told PEOPLE that he’s known since he was a teenager that one day he would get down on one knee there.

“When I was 17, I visited Venice for the first time and thought it was the most romantic place in the world.

“Can you believe he’s going to give me a baby?” she gushes.

“Get pregnant with me, on my second!” says Brie, who’s already a mom of one. “Oh my gosh. Could you imagine if we were pregnant at the same time?”

“It’d be crazy,” says Nikki. “I just can’t believe I get to be a mom — and with the man of my dreams. I don’t have to go find some guy to have a baby with.”

When the twins’ mom Kathy shows up, things get even more emotional.

“It’s been such an emotional couple of weeks,” says Kathy, tearing up. “I didn’t want it to be done, but I knew you had to go through what you had to and I’m just so proud of both of you — you and John.”

Of course, with the wedding back on, so is the stress that comes with planning.

“I feel like I’m still trying to process that John and I are back on and now I have to get back into wedding planning mode,” says Nikki. “And since we want to keep our same date, I am very behind. I feel like I have ideas in my head, but I think the only thing I actually have locked in right now is a place and an amazing wedding planning team.”

Initially set for release at the end of 2015, Ctrl experienced not one, but two setbacks before it finally dropped on June 9, 2017. Now, all the hard work has paid off because the RIAA revealed on Thursday that the album has officially gone platinum.

Fully aware that you only get one debut album, SZA admits that she was incredibly particular about which songs made the final cut. “I freestyle everything, all the way down,” she toldThe Guardian. “And I listen back and think, what’s shitty? And if something’s too shitty and I can’t put my finger on it, and I think, wow this sucks to me, then I get way frustrated, and usually scrap the song. I just kept fucking everything up. I just kept moving shit around.

She’s handled Trooping the Colour, as well as her first “off-site” day trip with the Queen, and on Tuesday, Meghan arrived at her first Royal Ascot, the formal carriage procession that marks the beginning of a five-day racing extravaganza in Berkshire.

Meghan arrived for the festivities in a carriage along with Prince Harry (donning a top hat), Prince Edward, and Countess Sophie, with Meghan spotted “sharing a joke” with Sophie as they made their way onto the premises. (It’s always amusing how even the slightest whispered aside at these events, when everyone is watching, become used as proof of a great convivial bond.)

Meghan again wore a Givenchy look, after working with the designer for both her wedding and her dress for her day with the Queen. And, as she has for nearly all her major events since becoming a royal, Meghan decided to wear a dress in the white-cream-beige family, as she chose a white collared dress, accessorized with a white and black Philip Treacy hat. (A royal correspondent for The Sun deemed the look “Audrey Hepburn-esque.”)

The Queen—in bright yellow—rode into the Ascot with Princess Anne, both no doubt in good spirits following the birth of Zara Phillips’s second daughter yesterday, another great-grandchild for the Queen and granddaughter for Princess Anne.

Chris Mundy is set to return as executive producer and showrunner.

Ozark, created by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams, was one of the big breakouts of 2017, with its freshman season believed to be one of the most streamed shows of that summer. While the second season did not seem to match the buzz and outsized popularity of the first, Ozark remains a hit Netflix series that also gets steady awards recognition, making the Season 3 renewal a no-brainer.

In the current second season, Ozark, headlined by Bateman and Laura Linney, continues to follow Marty Byrde (Bateman) and his family as they navigate the murky waters of life within a dangerous drug cartel. With Del out, the crime syndicate sends their ruthless attorney Helen Pierce to town to shake things up just as the Byrdes are finally settling in. Marty and Wendy (Linney) struggle to balance their family interests amid the escalating dangers presented by their partnerships with the power-hungry Snells, the cartel and their new deputy, Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner), whose father Cade has been released from prison. The stakes are even higher than before and the Byrdes soon realize they have to go all in before they can get out.

Bateman directed multiple episodes from the first and second season and serves as an executive producer along with Mundy, Dubuque and Williams. Ozark is produced by Bateman’s Aggregate Films in association with Media Rights Capital.",real

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The fourth suspect in the shooting death of emerging South Florida rap star XXXTentacion has turned himself in to authorities.

The Broward County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Tuesday evening that 20-year-old Trayvon Newsome was taken into custody after surrendering at his lawyer's Fort Lauderdale office around 5 p.m.

Newsome and three other men are accused of killing XXXTentacion (ex-ex-ex-ten-ta-see-YAWN) in June.

The gunmen fled with a Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000.

Newsome was booked into Broward County's Main Jail on charges of first-degree murder and robbery with a deadly weapon.

“I have enjoyed every single moment of it,” William said. “I have seen the growth of an idea transfer into what we see today – and it is a rare and immensely satisfying thing to have witnessed.”

In a sweet moment, Prince William talked about how his involvement in the organization earned him brownie points with his 4-year-old son, Prince George.

“Along the way I have demolished a building – George was at an age at the time that he loved seeing the digger in action, so it did my street cred as a father the world of good,” he quipped.

William is also dad to daughter Princess Charlotte, 3, and the 1-month-old Prince Louis. Next month, Prince Louis will be christened at St. James’ Palace in an official ceremony.

In May, the reality show was put on hold after a woman who appeared on the series alleged that she was sexually harassed by Shulman throughout filming. Schulman denied the allegations.

“Although we never received a formal complaint, MTV and Critical Content immediately engaged an independent third party investigator,” MTV said in a statement to ET. “The independent investigator found the allegations made in the YouTube videos to be not credible and without merit.”

“Given the results of the investigation, Catfish will resume filming. We take these matters very seriously and are committed to providing a safe working environment,"" the statement concludes.

Schulman also took to Twitter to thank fans for having his back.

""Appreciate the support from you and so many others. Excited to get back to work!"" he tweeted. ""Can’t express how much your support means to me. ?.""

In a YouTube video posted on May 12, Ayissha Morgan, who appeared on the show in 2015, went public with her accusations, claiming that the show's ""main person"" relentlessly hit on her during production of her episode, questioned her about being a lesbian and also propositioned her for sex.

In a statement to ET at the time, an MTV spokesperson said the network was conducting an investigation, and that production on the show had been paused.

“We take these allegations very seriously,” the statement read. “We’re working with Critical Content, our third party production company, to conduct a thorough investigation, and we’ve put a pause on shooting until the investigation is completed.”

Schulman denied the allegations in his own statement, writing, ""The behavior described in this video did not happen and I'm fortunate that there are a number of former colleagues who were present during this time period who are willing to speak up with the truth. I have always been transparent about my life and would always take responsibility for my actions -- but these claims are false.”

Schulman has been the host and executive producer of Catfish since 2012. In the show, Schulman and his filmmaking partner, Max Joseph, investigate whether people are telling the truth about who they say they are in their online relationships.

Less than one week after wishing Antonoff, 34, a happy Father’s Day, the Girls director, writer and star shared a selfie of the pair on Instagram.

In the photo, Dunham, 32, leans against Antonoff’s shoulder, while the Bleachers frontman flashes a big grin.

“Best friends 4ever,” she wrote alongside the image.

Despite calling it quits in January after five years of dating, Dunham and Antonoff have remained amicable.

Last week, while sharing a smiling photo of Antonoff that appeared to have been taken on June 13, she wrote that even though the pair had “broken up,” they had an unbreakable bond between them.

“Happy father’s day @jackantonoff,” she wrote. “We may have broken up but you still give me the finger from the London airport and that’s 4ever.”

Earlier this month, the friendly exes also raised a few eyebrows after exchanging some seemingly flirty messages on social media.

Noticing the early timestamp on a photo of Dunham and one of her cats, who passed away just days after the image was taken, Antonoff inquired about Dunham’s schedule, asking, “Why are you awake?”

“Cuz [sic] it’s the prime time to catch you on the gram, four eyes,” Dunham responded.

The former couple met in 2012 after being set up on a blind date by Antonoff’s sister Rachel and comedian Mike Birbiglia.

Days after PEOPLE confirmed Dunham and Antonoff’s split, she briefly addressed the breakup during a livestream on Instagram, saying she was still wearing a ring that Antonoff had given her.

William posed at the same exact spot seen here in this Middleton family photo:

Kate, who is still on maternity leave after welcoming Prince Louis on April 23, has very sweetly been on her husband's mind throughout his visit to Jordan. On Sunday, William shared how sad Kate was to miss this trip. According to People, William revealed Kate “is very sorry she cannot be here with me so soon after the birth of our son Louis, but her family remembers very fondly the almost three years she spent here as a child when her father worked for British Airways in Amman.""

far back as I can remember, I had always had a love and flare for fashion and style. Back in the day





growing up as a teenager in school, I remember wearing my school uniforms always a little different





from the other girls! I usually hemmed my skirts a little shorter and added some beads for good





measure…hahaha. Of course my friends, you can imagine that there was always some price to pay





on my part as the teachers were not particularly enamoured by my creativity!





Anyway…….., I had always wanted to be a model back then but because I never had the support or





professional guidance that was required to transform this dream into reality, I was never able to do





much about it and it remained just a dream for quite a long time, tucked away someplace in my





heart, waiting to blossom. Looking forwards however (notice how I didn’t say looking backwards?), I





honestly believe that this is the perfect time for me to showcase my love and flare for fashion and





style with the perfect backdrop of the maturity and self-confidence that I now possess. My three boys

And she was also already married to Offset.

It turns out the rappers secretly tied the knot back in September. On Monday, Cardi confessed that the couple had said their vows before she started wearing a giant diamond engagement ring and revealed they were pregnant.

""There are so many moments that I share with the world and then there are moments that I want to keep to myself! Getting married was one of those moments!"" Cardi B wrote in a memo shared on Twitter. ""Our relationship was so new ... but we was so in love we didn't want to lose each other (so) one morning in September we woke up and decided to get married.""

The ""Invasion of Privacy"" singer writes that she said ""I do"" without a dress, a ring, any makeup or guests, save for one cousin.

She wrote, ""I appreciate and love my husband so much for still wanting me to have the moment every girl dreams of when he got down on his knee and put a ring on my finger and he did that for me!!"" And, Cardi added, ""at least ya can stop saying i had a baby out of wedlock.""

Officers and paramedics were called to Lopez’s South Hope Street apartment Sunday night on a report of a possible suicide. Officers found Lopez unresponsive and he was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after 8 PM Sunday of a gunshot wound, coroner’s spokesman Ed Winter told Deadline.

Lopez appeared on the last two seasons of Operation Repo, which originally aired as a Spanish-language version on Telemundo and later crossed over to English language and moved to truTV in 2008. The show consisted of scripted and dramatized re-enactments in which actors “recreated” what were purported to be actual stories of car repossessions in LA’s San Fernando Valley.

Lopez’s other TV credits included guest roles on CSI: Cyber and iCarly. His film work included Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. His final film was 2017’s American Made, in which he played a CIA Station Chief opposite Tom Cruise.

The reality star said it will be ""very hard to relive"" Tristan Thompson’s cheating scandal when it airs on television. Kardashian was replying to a fan’s tweet saying the next episode, which will show the fallout of Thompson’s alleged cheating, “will be insane.”

“Sadly, it will,” Kardashian said about the next “KUWTK” episode. “I signed up to show the for the good and the bad, right? The bad is very hard to relive but it’s life.”

In April, several photos and videos emerged showing the NBA star appearing to cheat on Kardashian with several women. Videos posted by The Daily Mail showed Thompson inside a New York City nightclub apparently kissing another woman while Kardashian was nine months pregnant.

Kardashian gave birth to the couple’s first child, True Thompson, days after the reports emerged.

Kardashian previously defended her decision to stay with Thompson, telling a fan that she has “no knowledge of what goes on in our household or the enormous rebuilding [it] takes to even coexist.”

“I’m proud of my strength,” the Good American clothing founder tweeted.

But in recent weeks she has also posted cryptic messages about relationships.

The actress-slash-dancer recently launched her own beauty channel on YouTube and has since divulged all sorts of secrets—everything from her 3-concealer hack to the body oil she calls ""heaven in a bottle."" Next up? Dewan's revealing the secret to thick, enviable brows—that last all day and also look thick, yet natural.

Because, as she shares in this video on her YouTube channel, ""I really think brows frame a face,"" she says. ""I have nothing on the face, maybe a little bit of concealer, but if the brows are good, the face is framed and I'm ready to go."" To start this all off Dewan uses a spoolie to brush her brow hairs up and out, moving them away from her eyes so that they take up more space on the brow bone.

Then, she uses a waxy pencil (her choice: the Anastasia's Brow Definer Pencil), making tiny dashes on the on the tops of brows to strengthen the line, while still looking natural. She continues brushing the hairs up with the spoolie to help blend the pencil line with the hairs. While she used to do the same on the bottom edges of the arches, she stopped because it made the lines look too harsh.

To finish, she holds the look together with an inexpensive drugstore find: the $6 Maybelline's Great Lash Clear Mascara. ""I love this stuff,"" admits Dewan. ""It's not necessarily a brow gel, but it's clear mascara and it works just as good. Let me tell you, this stuff stays all day."" She sweeps the formula against the hair grain and up so that the arches look full and thick.

Or you know, in her words, like ""Brooke Shields natural brows."" She definitely makes a strong case for embracing the bold eyebrow. Easy makeup look, achieved—all for the price of a latte. Yes, please.

Thomas Markle told TMZ that he hasn’t been in contact with anyone from the palace, including Meghan, since he gave an interview with “Good Morning Britain” earlier this month.

Thomas, 73, famously missed her royal wedding to Prince Harry in May after it was revealed he staged paparazzi photos of himself leading up to the event.

He was reportedly hospitalized for a heart attack after the incident and hasn’t yet been across the pond to meet his daughter’s new family.

Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to meet with the royals in July.

“If the Queen is willing to meet our arrogant and insensitive president she has no excuse not to meet me,” Thomas griped to TMZ early Tuesday. “I’m nowhere near as bad.”

Still, Thomas reportedly has “every intention” of visiting the UK soon.

Thomas, who describes himself as fervently anti-Trump, previously revealed that Prince Harry urged him to give the POTUS a chance.

“He’s a smart guy,” Thomas said of his new son-in-law. “We talked a few times about Donald Trump and Brexit and things like that … I was complaining I didn’t like Donald Trump. He said, ‘Give Donald Trump a chance.’ I sort of disagreed with that, but I still like Harry. That was his politics. I have my politics.”

He added of Prince Harry potentially being a Trump supporter, “I would hope not, but at the time he might have been.”",real

Now, Amber Tamblyn, best known for her role in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movies, is adding her name to the growing pack of actresses who are done with Hollywood’s unfair beauty standards.

In an interview with The New York Times writer Jodi Kantor on Tuesday, the 35-year-old actress and activist opened up about her experience with size discrimination in the entertainment industry. Specifically, Tamblyn recalled one conversation with her agent who was told by a Warner Bros. executive that Tamblyn had the chance to become a huge star after 2008’s “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2″—if she lost weight.

“I think at that point I was 128 pounds and I’m 5-7. I remember my agent saying to me and she was a woman, ‘You have a real choice here. You can either be Nicole Kidman or you can be a character actress,'” Tamblyn said. “And at that time, I was like 21 years old, so if you look at that and use that as an example and imagine that for over two decades, forms of that from when you’re a child to all the way up, it does something to you.”

Tamblyn, who is a vocal member of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements, believes that the moment was indicative of the discrimination that women face in Hollywood to be “shut out” of certain opportunities if they don’t meet the industry’s beauty standards.",real

John Goodman, who plays Dan Conner, offered some insight on the fate of his onscreen wife, played by Barr. In a profile published on U.K.'s Times Sunday, Goodman said his character will be ""mopey and sad because his wife's dead.""

ABC announced the network would move forward with an unlikely spinoff, ""The Conners,"" after Barr's namesake show was abruptly cancelled following her racist tweet to former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett in May.

More from USA Today:

ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey called the tweet ""abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.""

Barr said her controversial tweet was misinterpreted and that she is not a racist, and Goodman agreed. ""I know, for a fact that she's not a racist,"" he told the Times Sunday.

Goodman admitted he was ""brokenhearted"" and ""surprised"" at the show's cancellation, before dialing it back: ""That's probably all I should say about it.""

-947678,Scarlett Johansson Denies “Demeaning” Claim She Auditioned to Date Tom Cruise,"Scarlett Johansson is fighting back against a claim that she auditioned to date Tom Cruise following his split from Nicole Kidman.

“The very idea of any person auditioning to be in a relationship is so demeaning. I refuse for anyone to spread the idea that I lack the integrity to choose my own relationships. Only a man aka Brendan Tighe would come up with a crazy story like that,” Johansson said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.

While appearing on NBC’s Megyn Kelly Today on Wednesday, Tighe said that while serving as a member of Cruise’s Scientology security unit, he came across reports of women who auditioned to be in a relationship with the actor, one of whom was Johansson. Tighe explained that he saw the reports after they were accidentally sent to his printer and that he recalled only Johansson’s name because hers was the only one he recognized.

“Another actress, Erika Christensen, had to disconnect from Scarlett Johansson because it didn’t go well. That was in that report,” Tighe said.

The Church of Scientology also denied Tighe’s claims regarding his role with Cruise.

Karin Pouw, from the Church of Scientology International, told Kelly, “Brendan Tighe was a Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization security guard/night watchman from 2002 to 2009. The ‘access’ he boasts of having was largely limited to viewing security cameras from a guard booth. He was removed from that position for dereliction of duty.”

Tighe’s accusation surrounding Johansson and Cruise is not the first time an alleged dating process for the actor has been rumored. According to a Vanity Fair article published in 2012, Scientology members underwent an audition process to see if they were a suitable match for Cruise. Actress Nazanin Boniadi was reportedly selected and was in a relationship with the actor from November 2004 to January 2005.",real

“Because it was right here [so close], I could see pores, I could see swelling, I could see freckles, I saw so much and I was just like, ‘Ugh’.

“So, what did I expect my face to look like? Photoshopped, filtered?”

Priyanka then goes on to point out that women have just become so accustomed to conditioning because they have always been told to look a certain way or act a certain way.

“So, I really thought about it in the walk from the computer to set, and I was like, ‘You know what it is, it’s conditioning.’

“For eons we have been told as women, that this is what we should look like, and this is the standard of beauty we need to follow.”

The 35-year-old continues: “Can we, for a second, love ourselves.”

'Victor was completely blindsided and is very heartbroken,' the insider added.

'He has been receiving a lot of backlash from the Riverdale community, even though it was actually Camila's choice to end the relationship.'

The couple - childhood friends from Florida - started the romance rumors back in June as they posted messages to each other's social media accounts.

Camila spoke to Nylon recently about dating someone outside her Hollywood industry.

'It’s just dating people in the industry is tough,' she explained.

'I did for a little bit. I’ve just dated actors. It’s hard when that’s your world. You only meet people through work and that can be really tough, because you’re not necessarily meeting people that you’re similar to.

'It’s just people that you’re with because you’re working on the same project. I’ve learned to not do that. Thank god nothing bad has ever happened from those experiences.

'I realize that I don’t think I like actors. Actors are really emotionally complicated. You would think they would be more in tune with their emotions, but sometimes they’re just not. I just really need to get out of this industry with someone who is in a stable environment,' she added.

Last week, the entrepreneur and Dedivanovic unveiled their upcoming KKW Beauty makeup collaboration, which launches on April 5th, which happens to be the 10-year anniversary of the day they met. The collection contains two lip glosses, a lipstick and an eye shadow palette, all based on the most iconic looks that the pro has created on Kardashian West. But for the pair, it’s about a lot more than just makeup — because the two were in tears while discussing the launch at a celebration dinner Friday night.

“I really am grateful that you guys came to see me and Mario. I feel like this has been 10 years in the making,” Kardashian West told her guests during a speech, which Dedivanovic shared on Instagram. “Everything I’ve learned about makeup has come from Mario.”

For the star, her relationship with Dedivanovic over the past 10 years didn’t stop at simply getting her makeup done. Instead, the two used their downtime during days off while filming Kim and Kourtney Take Miami to train her in makeup application, which she called a “fun game.”

“I would say, ‘OK I’m gonna wipe off half my face, and I want you to see and watch me do it and make sure I could, like, make it perfect just like yours,'” she shares. “And I would have him just teach me lesson after lesson of how to do makeup.”

Alongside the announcement, Delaney shared a video of himself speaking about how the U.K.’s National Health Service financially helped his family during Henry’s battle with brain cancer.

“See my sad love letter to the NHS below,” the actor added.

In February, the actor revealed that his son had died in January after battling brain cancer since 2016.

“Henry had been diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2016, shortly after his first birthday, following persistent vomiting and weight loss. He had surgery to remove the tumor and further treatment through the early part of 2017. Then the cancer returned last autumn and he died in January,” Delaney wrote in a statement shared on his Facebook page.

“Henry was a joy. He was smart, funny, and mischievous and we had so many wonderful adventures together, particularly after he’d moved home following 15 months living in hospitals,” continued Delaney, saying that even though Henry’s “tumor and surgery left him with significant physical disabilities,” his son had “quickly learned sign language and developed his own method of getting from A to B shuffling on his beautiful little bum.”

“His drive to live and to love and to connect was profound,” added Delaney.

The Deadpool 2 star went on to remark that while Leah and Henry’s two older brothers were “devastated of course,” they had also helped Delaney “endeavor to not go mad with grief.”

In April, Delaney also shared a touching tribute to his late son on what would have been the toddler’s third birthday. “Here’s Henry not long before he died,” the actor captioned a photo of his son on Twitter.

You need a 12-step program to break my spell.” Understandably, Mila tackling the lines all these years later had her cracking up in no time.

Confidential,” and Pearce suggests in a new interview with Australian talk show host Andrew Denton that Spacey got inappropriate with him during production. Spacey has been accused of sexual harassment and abuse by serval men, including “Star Trek: Discovery” and “Rent” actor Anthony Rapp.

During the interview, Pearce was asked about Spacey’s history of abuse and working with the actor early in their careers. Pearce did not want to reveal too much about his experiences with Spacey, but he did imply nonprofessional behavior when he said, “Yeah. Tough one to talk about at the moment. Amazing actor, incredible actor. Mmm. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah.”

Pearce followed the comment with the following remark, “He’s a handsy guy. Thankfully I was 29, and not 14.” According to Yahoo Entertainment, Denton’s audience could be heard gasping at Pearce’s revelation.

Pearce’s implication would not be the first time a high profile actor has come forward to reveal Spacey’s behavior on set. Gabriel Byrne said last December that Spacey’s “sexually inappropriate behavior” stopped production on “The Usual Suspects.” The film’s director, Bryan Singer, refuted the claim.

“I did not know honestly then the extent of his violence,” Byrne told The Sunday Times. “I mean, he was kind of a joke in that people would say, ‘That’s Kevin,’ but nobody really understood the depth of his predations. It was only years later that we began to understand that [filming] was closed down for a particular reason and that was because of inappropriate sexual behavior by Spacey.”

In the months since the first allegation against Spacey was made, the actor has remained entirely out of the spotlight.

His autopsy is pending. A rep for Tina did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

Craig is the son of Tina — who was just 18 when she gave birth to him — and saxophonist Raymond Hill, who performed with Ike Turner’s band Kings of Rhythm. Craig was adopted by Ike after he and Tina married in 1962.

Craig worked as a real estate agent in California, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Just hours before her son took his own life, Tina attended Giorgio Armani Privé Haute Couture fashion show in Paris, France, as part of the Haute Couture Paris Fashion Week.

The iconic singer has lived in Europe since 1995 with her German record-executive husband Erwin Bach. In 2013, she relinquished her American citizenship.

Tina has been open about the abuse she suffered at the hands of Craig’s adoptive father, Ike, who died in 2007.

In May 2005, Tina revealed to Oprah that it particularly took a toll on Craig, who “was a very emotional kid.”

“He’d always look down in sadness,” she said of her son’s response to her abuse. “One day when Ike was fighting me, Craig knocked on the door and said, ‘Mother, are you all right?’ I thought, ‘Oh, please, don’t beat me at home.’ I didn’t want my children to hear.”

The singer recently launched a musical based on her life, Tina, in London — which details every turbulent moment of her 50-year singing career.

She continued on to say, ""I'm eager to continue the upcoming passage of time dedicating myself to my art and my career, and the duration of my tour. I wish him the best. Thanks for respecting our privacy at this time."" Now, it appears as if Halsey may have her eyes on another tall wild boy, Machine Gun Kelly .

According to TMZ, the Halsey/G-Eazy break up was anticipated by friends close to the couple. Post Malone performed at the Hollywood Bowl last week, and during his performance, he called G-Eazy on stage. Halsey was in the audience for the show, but she and G-Eazy were not spotted together after the concert. That occurrence alone is odd, since the two were basically inseparable in public. Halsey made her way over to Poppy, a popular club in Hollywood, after the show for an after party. Keen-eyed fans and excited photographers were quick to notice that Eazy was nowhere in sight, but Machine Gun Kelly and Halsey were spotted hanging out.

""Riverdale"" star Lili Reinhart shared her disappointment over the bashing that she received from social media due to the way she perceived her body.

The 21-year-old actress talked about dealing with body dysmorphia on Twitter after earning a lot of flak from numerous social media trolls due to her Grace Kelly-inspired spread with Harper's Bazaar that was released on Monday.

The trolls particularly criticized her for saying how Marilyn Monroe inspires her, saying that the legendary actress did not care if she was curvy when she was still alive.

According to Reinhart, people should not tell others that they have no right to feel insecure because their body looked okay.

""Telling someone they don't deserve to feel insecure because their body is 'fine' or 'just like' whomever.. is wrong,"" the actress tweeted on Monday, July 2. ""That's part of the problem. That's part of body shaming,"" she added.

She also added that she cannot understand how people can hide behind their social media accounts and tell another person that their feelings are not valid and should be considered as ""whining"" just because they believe that the other person already showed the ideal shape or figure. In another series of tweets, Reinhart said that she was sad to see other people blatantly tell her what she feels. ""Feeling really disheartened by the fact that so many people are saying 'you're skinny so shut up about embrscing [SIC] your body.' As if my body dysmorphia is irrelevant because of how I look to some people. I'm either not curvy enough or not skinny enough to feel insecure,"" the actress, who is known for portraying the role of Betty Cooper in ""Riverdale,"" stated in her post.

Mayo Clinic described body dysmorphic disorder as a mental disorder which makes a person believe that there are one or more flaws in their appearance even if others could not see it.

The actress then appealed to her followers to show more respect to others.",real
-949327,‘Big Brother’: CBS Responds To “Inappropriate Behavior & Offensive Comments” By Cast Members,"CBS has released a statement following outrage by fans over inappropriate behavior and racist comments by some cast members in Season 20.

“Big Brother is a reality show about watching a group of people who have no privacy 24/7 — and capturing every unfiltered moment and conversation in their lives. At times, the houseguests reveal prejudices and exhibit behavior that we do not condone,” CBS said in a statement to Deadline. “The producers have addressed two such incidents that were seen recently on the 24/7 online feed. In both cases, those involved have been warned about their inappropriate behavior and offensive comments, as well as future consequences. These events will not be part of any future Big Brother broadcast on CBS.”

The most recent incident occurred Monday night on the show’s 24/7 feed when cast members Rachel Swindler and Angela Rummans used the term “ghetto” when comparing their tans, sparking swift backlash by fans on Twitter. Fans previously accused cast member JC Mounduix of sexual harassment for inappropriately touching contestants, with some calling for Mounduix’s ouster from the show.

This is not the first time the series has dealt with controversial issues. In 2013, some cast members in season 15 made racist and homophobic remarks during their time on the show. And in Season 2, CBS ejected Justin Sebik from the show after he held a knife to the throat of a female housemate.",real

The father of eight posted a festive Instagram of the two on Wednesday, writing “Happy 4th of July!!! 🇺🇸”

Jon, 41, and Kate Gosselin, 43, finalized their divorce in 2009. Since the former Jon & Kate Plus 8 stars’ separation, Jon has been focused on his DJing career and battled his ex-wife for custody of the sextuplets and 17-year-old twins Mady and Cara.

Though he wished them a happy birthday via Instagram in October, Jon remains estranged from the twins. In August 2016, Mady and Cara told PEOPLE that they weren’t speaking to their father, who had given interviews to some media outlets about their strained relationship.

“He makes it seem like we’re being kept from him, which is insane,” Mady said. “He should maybe spend some time thinking about why we don’t want to see him, and maybe realize that if he ever does want a relationship with us, talking about us on TV is not the way to make that happen.”

“He doesn’t even know us,” she added. “How can he dare to talk about us?”

But Jon has been spending plenty of time with Hannah, including at a Father’s Day weekend dinner with his girlfriend Colleen at Buddakan in Atlantic City, New Jersey, last month. In May, Jon and Hannah celebrated her 14th birthday together and paid a visit to her brother Collin, who is currently enrolled in a program away from home for children with special needs.

Sources tell Variety that the “Felicity” alum is in early talks to join J.J. Abrams’ “Star Wars: Episode IX,” which Abrams is writing and directing. Russell and Abrams last collaborated on 2006’s “Mission: Impossible III.”

The role calls for action-heavy fight scenes. Russell has shown her ability to perform tough stunts in projects like FX’s “The Americans,” “Mission: Impossible,” and “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.”

Abrams and Lucasfilm execs met with several actresses for the role in the past two months and settled on Russell right before the Fourth of July holiday. Abrams will likely cast two more actors by the time the film begins production at the end of the month. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver are all expected to return.

Abrams helmed “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” and was asked to come back to direct this latest installment after Colin Trevorrow exited following creative differences. Abrams filled the role last fall and has spent most of that time working on the script with Chris Terrio.

It’s unknown at this time whether Russell will be on the side of the rebels or the evil empire.

Russell recently wrapped the final season of “The Americans.” She is repped by WME and manager Joannie Burstein.",real

And the romance between Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus seems to be going from strength to as they enjoy summer together.

With the beautiful blonde on a break from Saturday Night Live, the 38-year-old producer is free to leave New York where it films and spend time with Ben in Los Angeles.

'Spending more time together': Ben Affleck is said to be 'very happy' that his lady love Lindsay Shookus can spend summer in L.A. now that SNL has finished filming, according to insiders

The Justice League star, 45 — who recently wrapped Netflix's Triple Frontier, in Hawaii — is fine with that.

'He's great,' a source told People in this week’s issue. 'He seems very happy that Lindsay is in L.A. now.'

Ben and Lindsay have recently been spotted out at restaurants together.

Walking the dogs: Ben, 48, joined Lindsay, 38, for a hike with their dogs and her parents, Christine and Robert Shookus, in the Santa Monica mountains on June 24

The couple dined at Capo in Santa Monica on Saturday night, as Ben escorted his lady love from the car to the restaurant with his arm around her.

They also enjoyed a meal at Italian eatery Felix Trattoria in nearby Venice on June 18.

And he took Lindsay's parents, Christine and Robert Shookus, out to Southeast Asian restaurant Cassia when they visited Ben's Los Angeles home later that week.

Grabbing a drink: The Justice League star opted for an iced coffee when the couple were spotted out in Los Angeles in November

Lindsay is staying at Ben's $19 million mansion on and off, as well as her own place in L.A.

And although she will have to return to the East Coast once filming on SNL starts up, for now 'they’re enjoying doing normal couple things and exploring L.A. together,' one of Ben's pals dished to People.

Meanwhile, Ben has yet to introduce Lindsay to his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, who is the mother of his children Violet, 12, Seraphina, nine, and son Samuel, six.",real
-949910,Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel Parent-Shamed for Son's Long Hair,"Parent-shaming is a mainstay of social media and, on occasion, can actually be helpful. If a commenter tells a celebrity (or a friend) not to do something that might hurt their kid, well, that’s useful. However, the comments section of many celebrity fathers’ accounts are full of deeply unhelpful advice. Take, for instance, Justin Timberlake’s account, which now features a photo of his son, Silas Timberlake, kissing his mom, Jessica Biel, followed by a mass of comments about the length of his son’s hair. According to internet busybodies — mostly male and mostly very certain of their views — having long hair is going to somehow damage the kid long-term.

The picture was taken in Paris and shows the three-year-old with shoulder length hair and a very loud and boat-themed romper kissing his mom on the lips. The caption reads, “If that pic doesn’t say ‘City Of Love’ then I’m out….” Privileged? Yes. Charming? Absolutely. Nonetheless, the internet did its thing.

“I thought that son was a daughter which is just another reason why it shouldn’t grow out,” wrote one commenter, before another took issue with his romper.

“Long hair and feminine-romper looking thing… sheesh,” wrote another.

And then the back and forth begain.

“Who cares if his hair is long!” wrote one JT supporter. “We should focus on raising kind children, so maybe they don’t grow up and become mean grown-ups that usual social media as a bullying platform!”

“Can we stop thinking about his hair fl and marvel in the wonderful opportunity this child has of having loving parents, who on top of that take him to Paris at such a young age,” wrote another. (The likely answer is “no,” but it’s a worthy sentiment.)

Parent shaming is always annoying, but this example might be the worst to date as it checks both the “Who cares?” box and the “That’s Not a Thing” box. Also, these people are all failing to appreciate that the kid has very cool hair. Do with it what you will Silas, you’ve been blessed with a rock star mane.",real

Taylor Swift, 28, has thrown some pretty epic Fourth of July parties in years past, but she’s forwent the epic celebration in 2017, and now again in 2018. This year, she instead spent her time off from touring to go to Turks and Caicos with boyfriend Joe Alwyn, 27.

“Taylor likes keeping things a little more low key nowadays because it works for her to have alone time and she is enjoying the time she needs and has with Joe,” a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. “It is very important for her for that to be private.”

The 10-time Grammy winner has been keeping her relationship under wraps. The pair have only been photographed out together a handful of times despite dating for well over a year. Taylor also rescinded from the spotlight in 2016, and has been living more privately ever since. Our insider adds that the “Delicate” hitmaker intends on keeping her life this way. “She is not interested in all the craziness from previous years. She has matured to this way of life and it fits and suits her so well,” our source explains. “She is happy and healthy and she’ll definitely continue this moving forward.”

The couple said “I do” for the second time in front of a small group of friends and family, including Carrozzini’s aunt, Carla Sozzani (sister of his mother) in the town’s San Giorgio church.

Because of the couple’s strict no social media policy during their first wedding, this is the first time we’ve officially seen Shaffer in a wedding gown. The bride chose an ivory V-neck lace gown with a tea-length skirt and matching lace veil. She accessorized with a cross necklace and gold strappy sandals.

The groom wore a navy double-breasted suit with brown loafers.

While it’s still unknown what dress design Shaffer wore for her first nuptials, there are rumors it’s being kept under wraps until it can be unveiled in an upcoming Vogue issue.

The singer asked Hailey Baldwin‘s father, Stephen Baldwin, for permission before proposing, TMZ reports.

Sources told the site that Bieber, 24, met with Stephen weeks before popping the question to the “Biodome” actor’s 21-year-old daughter.

The conversation reportedly centered on religion, as Bieber, Hailey and Stephen are all practicing Christians, with Hailey and Bieber being particularly active in the Hillsong Church.

Bieber proposed to Hailey at an exclusive Bahamas resort on Saturday, complete with a massive oval-shaped diamond ring worth roughly $400,000.

Stephen previously celebrated their engagement news with a since-deleted series of social media posts, complete with scripture about marriage.

A rep for Stephen declined to comment on the engagement to Page Six.

Hailey’s cousin, model Ireland Baldwin, also marked the occasion with a sweet Instagram post declaring Hailey to be “one less lonely girl,” a reference to Bieber’s 2009 hit.

Hailey and Bieber have been friends for years and have had an on-again, off-again romance since roughly 2016.

The pair have engaged in heavy PDA for roughly a month, much to the chagrin of Bieber’s former Calabasas, Calif., neighbor, who demanded a warrant for his arrest after the crooner allegedly skipped out on a deposition to gallivant with his girlfriend in the Big Apple.

Bieber confirmed the engagement news in a gushing Instagram post on Monday night that likely delighted Hailey’s proud papa.

“I promise to lead our family with honor and integrity letting Jesus through his Holy Spirit guide us in everything we do and every decision we make,” Bieber wrote. “My heart is COMPLETELY and FULLY YOURS and I will ALWAYS put you first!

Clooney is thrown over the front of his bike and up in the air before landing on the asphalt, where the car driver and other witnesses come to help.

The John Paul II hospital in Olbia confirmed Clooney was treated there and released after a few hours.

Local media representatives who gathered at the hospital said the Oscar-winning actor-director left in a van through a side exit.

The newspaper La Nuova Sardegna said the 57-year-old Clooney was heading to a film set when the accident happened at a curve in the road near the entrance to the Costa Corallina residential compound in the province of Olbia.

An oil stain and police paint remained on the road. Photographs taken by someone passing the scene showed the car’s front right bumper damaged and Clooney’s bike on its side.

Clooney reportedly was in Sardinia filming a television miniseries adapted from Joseph Heller’s World War II novel Catch-22.

He has been staying at a lush, gated rental villa in the high-end Puntaldia neighborhood on Sardinia’s northeastern coast, which overlooks the Tyrrhenian Sea. Staff at the home declined to comment.

Clooney is a frequent visitor to Italy. He has a home on Lake Como and was married in Venice in 2014 to British human rights attorney Amal Clooney.",real

John Legend has made history as the youngest person ever to achieve that sweet, sweet coveted EGOT status.

That's someone who has received the big four, the holy grail of performance accolades: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards.

Legend, 39, completed the acronym at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, as did Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, all for producing best variety special winner Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert.

He's also the first black man to land EGOT status, making history in more ways than one.

Legend also played the role of Jesus in NBC's production of the 1970 concept album-turned-Broadway musical, so he's also up for the Emmy for outstanding actor in a limited series or movie, which will be revealed at the big primetime Emmy Awards on Monday.

""Before tonight, only 12 people had won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony in competitive categories,"" wrote Legend on Instagram.

""Sirs Andrew Lloyd Webber, Tim Rice and I joined that group when we won an Emmy for our production of their legendary show Jesus Christ Superstar. So happy to be part of this team. So honored they trusted me to play Jesus Christ. So amazed to be in such rarefied air.""

There are actually a total of 14 other EGOT recipients, including Audrey Hepburn, Scott Rudin, Mel Brooks. Two of these, Whoopi Goldberg and songwriter Robert Lopez, have won a daytime Emmy.

Legend's wife and supreme social media queen Chrissy Teigen posted a photo of the three ""EGOT GOATS"" on Twitter:

Now, we're just waiting for Teigen's dad's response.

-951568,Madelaine Petsch Uses $14 Pacifica Eyebrow Gel,"Madelaine Petsch is the actor/redhead/villain/heroine/human of my dreams. I mean, aside from being phenomenal as Cheryl Blossom in Riverdale, Petsch is also a makeup and skin addict, talking quite candidly about her beauty routine in interviews. The most recent product favorite of Petsch’s? A $14 eyebrow gel. Yes, that's finally something you can afford.

The Details

In a video posted to her YouTube channel, Petsch broke down her summer beauty look with a makeup tutorial, showing fans exactly how she conceals her skin (with Tarte Shape Tape, of course), contours her eyes (with Wander Beauty Catch the Light Highlighter), and, of course, fills in her signature thick brows. Her favorite product? Pacifica Stunning Brows Eyebrow Gloss in Golden Brown.

""It's a really nice, cruelty-free brand,” says Petsch in the video, before applying the gel. “I kinda just lightly brush the hairs up for a nice full brow that I don't have naturally."" And unlike brow gels that tend to be gloopy or thick (you know—the ones that leave marks on your brow bones), Pacifica’s formula is lightweight and relatively sheer, using sunflower seed oil to smooth hair and add shine, along with a sheer does of golden-brown pigments for color.

(Image credit: Courtesy of Brand)

Basically, if you’re looking for a subtle wash of color across your brows, this formula is an excellent pick. Still, because it doesn’t contain any thickening fibers (like many brow gels do), I’d recommend filling in your brows with a pencil or powder, first, to define the shape and add some bulk.

Watch the rest of Petsch’s tutorial, below, and then recreate the look on yourself! I can’t promise you’ll look like a Riverdale star by the time you’re done, but, hey, it can’t hurt to try.

Kim Kardashian West has been toppled from the top spot, with new mom Kylie Jenner (20) the new richest in the Kardashian-Jenner clan.

The youngest of reality TV family is now said to be worth a whopping $386m (R4.6bn).

According to Daily Mail, this is all thanks to her make-up empire, which has her eye-watering net worth set to rise to $1bn (R11.9bn) by 2022.

“I think truly, I put a lot of hard work into this,” Kylie told LOVE magazine of her cosmetics range, which includes the in-demand lip kits. “It's not like I am doing this to make money. I don't even think about that part.”

Sister Kim is ranked second richest with an £127m (R2.1bn) fortune, and brother Rob is at the bottom with a net worth of £5.7m (R94m).

A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jun 26, 2017 at 1:08am PDT

The news comes at a particularly celebratory time for Kylie, who welcomed her first child named Stormi, with her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott.

“Kylie's first few days of motherhood have been the happiest of her life,” reports Daily Mail.

It’s no wonder that when she finally showed off her pregnancy in her baby announcement video, she also gave fans a sneak peek into her daughter’s wardrobe – which is already rumoured to be worth an estimated $70k (R840k).

Cookbook author Teigen situates herself in the kitchen, where she fills the ship’s position as “chief stew,” or stewardess. Everyone aboard hilariously poses for the camera as their name flashes on the screen, just like actors often did for seemingly every TV show in the ’80s. Some of them imitate the Bravo fan favorite, like when celeb stylist Jen Atkin pretends to get sick over the side of the boat as a nod to the seasick cast member — make that mate — Kasey, on Below Deck Mediterranean.

In a statement, the premium cable outlet explained that the omission of its two biggest series from Comic-Con was a purely logistical choice, noting that ""production schedules and air dates"" for the splashy series conflicted with the July event.

Here are HBO's remarks in full:

""Due to production schedules and air dates for Game of Thronesand Westworld, these series will not be presented at San Diego Comic-Con this summer. HBO has a longstanding relationship with SDCC, and we are very grateful for the fans' enthusiastic response over the years. We look forward to returning in the future.""

HBO has offered a ""Game of Thrones"" panel every year since the show's premiere. Skipping it now, ahead of the launch of the show's eighth and final season in 2019, seems more than a little anti-climactic. And while ""Westworld"" only made its Comic-Con debut last year, it seemed by all accounts poised for another buzzy panel in 2018, following all of its season two shakeups.

Of course, HBO isn't the only notable name that won't be presenting a panel in Hall H this year: Marvel is also passing on that noteworthy annual event, instead simply offering fans a floor exhibit honoring 10 years of the MCU. But according to Deadline, HBO won't even be doing that, skipping any sort of Comic-Con presence entirely (and that includes a rumored sneak peek at one of the potential ""Thrones"" spinoffs). Bummer.

-952733,Katy Perry Suffered From “Situational Depression” Due to Widely Panned Witness Album,"Rather than letting herself sulk in self-pity, the performer chose to view the rough patch as a learning experience. She explained, “Music is my first love and I think it was the universe saying: ‘Okay, you speak all of this language about self-love and authenticity, but we are going to put you through another test and take away any kind of validating ‘blankie.’ Then we’ll see how much you do truly love yourself.'”

She continued on to say, “That brokenness, plus me opening up to a greater, higher power and reconnecting with divinity, gave me a wholeness I never had. It gave me a new foundation. It’s not just a material foundation: it’s a soul foundation.”

This spiritual awakening comes as no surprise to fans of the “I Kissed A Girl” singer. In February, the star told Glamour, “This last year has been about killing my ego, which has been really necessary for my career. But for my personal life, it doesn’t work that way. If I want to have that true balance, I have to step into being Katheryn Hudson.”

That back-to-basics mentality has helped the 33-year-old to value the relationships and people around her, like rumored boyfriend Orlando Bloom.

In April, the songstress and her actor boyfriend were able to meet the Pope as part of Unite to Cure conference in Vatican City. It was at the gathering that the pop star sung her praises about meditational therapy, which she claims “helped a lot with my anxiety.”

-952630,Taylor Swift Meets Fan Fighting Brain Cancer — and Meghan McCain Arranged the Dream Meeting!,"Taylor Swift and Meghan McCain teamed up to make one special fan’s dream come true!

Twenty-one-year-old Lexi Caviston’s dream turned into reality when the Philadelphia native was able to meet the pop star, 28, at her Lincoln Financial Field show on Saturday.

The meeting was made possible after McCain, 33, came across a tweet that Caviston’s best friend, Alexandra, wrote as part of the social media campaign #LexiStrong. “My best friend Lexi was diagnosed with brain cancer (glioblastoma) in December. We’re going to the #reputationstadiumtour on July 14th in Philly and it’s her dream to meet @taylorswift,” the tweet read.

McCain quickly joined the effort to help Caviston. Her father John McCain is also battling glioblastoma after being diagnosed in July 2017.

“She has the same brain cancer my dad does,” McCain explained during Monday’s episode of The View.

“I am so happy that we were able to help Lexi forget about her cancer for one day,” she said. “She spoke to our producer and said it was by far the best day of her life.”

""The Dark Knight"" is coming back for a limited run, as one of the most critically acclaimed superhero films ever comes back to celebrate its 10th year anniversary. The second part of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy will be showing for one week in four theaters on Friday, Aug. 24, and will be screened in IMAX 70mm.

The movie has been a commercial and critical success in all aspects when it first came out in 2008. As the first superhero movie to gross more than $1 billion box office sales, ""The Dark Knight"" has provided the template against which superhero movies have since been measured by, as Forbes pointed out.

The movie is currently considered the 35th highest grossing movie, in all categories, of all time, as well.

Chief among its many highlights is the brilliant performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker, a tremendous portrayal that has earned the actor a posthumous Oscar award for Best Supporting Actor, and a turn at the character that has set the bar since.

Aside from the acting and direction, ""The Dark Knight"" was also a breakthrough in technical filmmaking, being the first mainstream movie shot using IMAX cameras and the first feature-length release, at more than two and a half hours long, to have used IMAX Digital Media Remastering technology.

That means this year's screening of ""The Dark Knight"" can be shown in full IMAX 70mm quality as the movie returns in four venues by next month.

The movie will be shown for one week starting Aug. 24 in the AMC Universal Citywalk IMAX in Universal City California, AMC Lincoln Square IMAX in New York City, AMC Metreon IMAX in San Francisco and Ontario Place Cinesphere IMAX in Toronto, as listed out by Entertainment Weekly.

Each venue will screen the 10th-anniversary re-release in IMAX and will be limited to one daily screening for now.",real

Why 'Harry Potter' fans are freaking out about 'Fantastic Beasts' sequel title

— -- The title for the sequel to ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" was revealed today and it has ""Harry Potter"" fans going crazy with excitement.

The sequel, expected to hit theaters next year, is called ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" Warner Bros. announced. And the title gives clues on exactly where the second installment of this film series is headed.

""Harry Potter"" fans already know that ""Fantastic Beasts"" is a spin-off of sorts to the famed wizarding film series.

Scene from ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.""

In fact, Harry Potter studied a book written by Newt Scamander called ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" while he was in class at Hogwarts. The first movie follows Scamander and the magical creatures he collected and documented.

""The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" however, is centered on Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp, who is Albus Dumbledore's longtime rival.

In this film, the Hogwarts headmaster, portrayed by Jude Law, tries to track down Grindelwald after the wizard escapes custody. To help him in his search, Dumbledore enlists his former student and magizoologist Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne.

Author J. K. Rowling, who wrote the screenplay for the first film, also lent her talents to ""The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" which also features Zoe Kravitz as Leta Lestrange, a pure-blood witch now engaged to Scamander's brother.

The sequel, ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" also has a special release date -- Nov. 16, 2018. It's nearly 17 years after the initial ""Harry Potter"" film, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" hit theaters.",real

According to Diane von Furstenberg, Viagra is the “worst thing that has happened to women in the last 15 years.” In a new interview with The Times, the legendary fashion designer said that it used to be that men weren’t really fathering children after 65, but now, “Now, with Viagra … they just feel…”

“For men it used to be all about getting it up. ‘Did I?’ ‘Can I?’ There was a certain fairness,” she said. “A woman couldn’t have a child after 40, right? Though even that doesn’t exist any more.”

DVF also shared that she and her husband have separate residences in New York, and that in L.A., she often sleeps in the guest bedroom because her husband “sleeps with two dogs inside the bed.”

Von Furstenberg’s sentiments about Viagra extend to her approach to aging in general: She just wants us all to stop fighting against time. “Age means you have lived,” she said. “I am 71, but I should be 140 I have lived so fully.” She added that she finds it “humiliating” that women in their 30s try to shy away from embracing their age and dislikes the fact that “even young girls [are] doing things to their faces.”

While walking the red carpet at the 2018 ESPYS, Patrick, 36, and Rodgers, 34, looked to be smitten with each other. Though the couple confirmed their relationship in January, they first met at the ESPY awards in 2012.

“We both remember meeting each other; it was quick,” the female professional race-car driver said on Jenny McCarthy’s SiriusXM radio show in May. “I got his email address, and I remember thinking to myself, ‘Oh, not a phone number? Just an email address?’”

Those emails must have sparked something more as the two looked gaga for each other, with Rodgers dressed in a black tuxedo and Patrick in a one-shoulder dress with metallic polka dots.

In fact, with its false identity premise, Second Act (watch the trailer below) bears more than a passing resemblance to 2002’s Maid in Manhattan, but instead of a hotel employee with ideas above her station, she plays a Whole Foods-type grocery store’s assistant manager who is passed over for promotion, only to trick her way into a fancy new job under false credentials.

Hired as a consultant for a major beauty company, Lopez’s character, Maya, finds herself going head-to-head with hotshot young executive Zoe (Vanessa Hudgens) in a race against the clock to create a new skincare line. Can Maya prove her lack of tertiary education doesn’t prevent her from excelling? And what of her relationship with boyfriend Trey (Milo Ventimiglia), who is tried of waiting to start a family?

If that were the extent of the plot, Second Act would be a fun but predictable journey towards the inevitable comeuppance for the doubters, but a whole other storyline unfolds that makes the exercise even more preposterous. If you can suspend your disbelief, this is harmless frivolity, with plenty of scene-stealing moments from co-star Leah Remini; if you can’t, admire Lopez and Hudgens’ array of stunning outfits instead.

""I'm gonna beat the sh—,"" she jokingly threatens in response to his prank. He just smiles and says, ""Number one!"" to the camera.





The clip is a candid, intimate, and sweet portrait of their relationship that says, ""See? Everything's normal!""



Fans have seen Hemsworth pull that stunt on Cyrus before. This spring, Miley posted a selfie video from the front seat where she and Liam are dancing in the front seat during a drive—but then he shouts, ""Oh sh*t!"" and causes her to drop her phone.

Focus Features announced Friday it has set an official production timeline for a cinematic continuation of the beloved British television series, one that will release in theaters with key members of the show’s principal cast returning for the project.

Though an official cast list has yet to be revealed, EW has learned Michelle Dockery, Hugh Bonneville, Maggie Smith, and Joanne Froggatt — each of whom have appeared in the PBS series since its first season back in 2010 — will be among those coming back for the movie, which begins filming later this year. Focus Features and Universal Pictures International are distributing the film around the world.

The show’s Oscar-winning creator Julian Fellowes wrote the film’s screenplay and is set to produce the picture alongside Carnival Films’ Gareth Naeme, Liz Trubridge, and executive producer Nigel Marchant. The Book Thief filmmaker Brian Percival, who helmed the show’s pilot episode, will direct. Plot details are still under wraps.

Across six seasons of its original run, Downton Abbey — set in the wealthy Crawley family’s country estate as it followed their intricate lives as well as those of the servants they employed at the turn of the 20th century — garnered a steady international following and sustained critical acclaim. It won three Golden Globes and 15 Emmys on top of 69 total nominations over the years.

“When the television series drew to a close it was our dream to bring the millions of global fans a movie and now, after getting many stars aligned, we are shortly to go into production,” Naeme said of the film via press statement. “Julian’s script charms, thrills and entertains and in Brian Percival’s hands we aim to deliver everything that one would hope for as Downton comes to the big screen.”",real

The actor portrayed Sam Carmichael in the 2008 jukebox movie featuring the songs of Swedish pop group ABBA and is reprising his role in the follow-up, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.

While Pierce’s singing in the films have divided fans, he shared during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night (19Jul18) that his friend Barbra’s pet dog Samantha didn’t seem to appreciate his vocal ability.

“Barbra Streisand is a friend, she lives in the same community, so we thought we’d show it to Barbra. We went over to her house and put the movie on and she said, ‘Come sit beside me, darling.’ I sat there thinking, ‘Oh my God, what am I doing, showing this to Barbra Streisand?'” he recalled of his first viewing of the flick. “And the movie finished and she said, ‘That was absolutely wonderful.’ I said, ‘Thank you so much.’ And at that point, her dog Sammie bit my arm. She said, ‘Sammie, are you alright?’ And I said, ‘But Barbra, she just bit me!'”

During the interview, Pierce went on to share that he was “terrified” of singing during both films. However, he was comforted by the fact that his co-stars Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard were very nervous too.

“The only thing that comforted me was seeing Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard looking equally as terrified on the day we did the recordings,” the 65-year-old smiled, adding that ABBA’s Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus were very supportive on set. “Benny and Bjorn are wonderful guys – legendary.”

Because Chris Klein has finally addressed that leaked 'Mamma Mia' audition video. And this is what he had to say:

The Huffington Post's Mike Ryan sat down with the actor to discuss 'American Reunion' and the trajectory of Klein's career. When asked about the leaked audition tape, Klein took it in stride:

""I took a chance -- I can't sing! I don't know why I was in there. But I took a chance! It's a musical -- let's see if I can give it a shot. And, you know, the way that they put it out there, it gets taken out of context and all that kind of thing. It was really a dreadful audition.""

The KKW Beauty founder shared another photo of herself on Friday rocking a teeny vintage Chanel black-and-white bikini that left little to the imagination, and her 118 million Instagram followers' reactions were completely divided. Some people -- including some of her famous pals -- praised the star for her svelte physique, while others called her out and questioned why she felt the need to share the skin-baring snap.

""Same,"" Amy Schumer commented. ""This body is giving us life!!"" her best friend, Simon Huck, posted. ""That's hot,"" Paris Hilton said.

Others weren't as friendly.

""This is ridiculous,"" one user wrote. ""This lady really loves attention. This is not normal.""

See the photo in the gallery below:



""I don't [really] do this, but this time I feel like I must. What point really, showing off a body that is not made of anything but plastic,"" someone else sounded off. ""And for what for strangers to look at? Save it for your man instead. It's really sad and that's a call for desperate need of attention. You have three beautiful kids and a man that loves you. Be aware of your choices. You should be ashamed.""

Someone else noted that it was ""time to unfollow Kim.""

Of course, Kardashian has made a career out of exhibiting polarizing behavior, especially on social media where she tends to share her most boundary-pushing content. Judging from her past habits, she likely won't react to the criticism that she received for the photo that she posted on Friday -- she can't be bothered!

By now, you better know that tanning is dangerous. Exposure to the sun's harmful UV rays boosts your risk of skin cancer, and studies suggest that people who use tanning beds triple their risk of melanoma.

That said, we get it: sometimes you still want that bronzed, just-back-from-the-beach glow (minus the skin cancer risk, of course). That's why there are hundreds of skin-safe self-tanning options out there that can take you from pale and pasty to sunny and summery in minutes. But as anyone who's ever wound up with streaky, orange skin can attest, not all of these products are created equal.

To the rescue: Amazon. Why test out dozens of tanning lotions, liquids, and mousses yourself when you can trust the thousands of reviewers to do the work for you? Each of these highly rated products has racked up a 5-star rating of at least 50% (if not more). Pick one that suits your preferred price range and application method, and get ready to glow all summer.",real

On Sunday, the pair once again fueled romance rumors with an outing together in Tokyo. Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) took Hadid to the renowned Robot Restaurant, an extremely unconventional dinner theater experience featuring performers dressed as monsters, animals and yes, robots.

The “Call Out My Name” crooner shared a video on his Instagram Story featuring Hadid cracking up while watching the performance. It ended with one of the restaurant’s robot-costumed actors playfully taking a fall.

Although Tesfaye and Hadid called it quits in 2016, they began to be spotted out together again -- including a PDA-filled night in Cannes back in May -- not long after Selena Gomez and he broke things off in 2017.

As recently as July 2, both Hadid and Tesfaye shared strikingly similar photos, seemingly teasing that they were spending time together. In the singer’s Instagram photo, he looks out over a balcony at what appears to be his home in Hidden Hills, California. Hadid’s image appears to have been taken moments later and features the same view but from further back, and includes the home’s spacious pool.

""It's unfortunate that anyone can file a police report whether it is true or false,"" says a statement sent to USA TODAY on Sunday by Cindy Guagenti, the actor's representative. ""The authorities have not contacted Anthony or any of his representatives about this matter. Anthony unequivocally disputes the claim.""

The allegations against Anderson, 47, were first reported by The Blast.

An unidentified woman claimed he assaulted her more than a year ago after meeting Anderson at an event he hosted, according to the site.

The incident, she says, happened the second time they met to discuss future business opportunities.

The LAPD confirms that Anderson is under investigation.

“At this point, all we can confirm is that there is an active investigation,” public information director Josh Rubenstein told USA TODAY.

The alleged victim filed a police report with LAPD's Hollywood Division earlier this year after finding comfort with the #MeToo movement, The Blast reports.

The accusations come less than two weeks after Anderson received his fourth Emmy nomination for outstanding lead actor in a comedy series for ""Black-ish.""

Anderson previously faced assault allegations in 2004, when a woman claimed Anderson and assistant director Wayne Witherspoon raped her in a trailer on set of “Hustle & Flow.”

The charges against both men were dismissed after a judge ruled there was no probable cause.

The 53-year-old must perform 50 hours of community service, is barred from drinking alcohol, must attend two Alcoholics Anonymous meetings per week, attend a victim impact class with Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and write a letter of apology to a Palm Beach Police officer, according to court documents.

There, police said de Lesseps and a man were found drunk in a hotel room and refused to leave. De Lesseps locked herself in the bathroom, according to a sworn affidavit, and when officers tried to open the bathroom door, de Lesseps shoved one of them in the chest and slammed the door on another officer, hitting the officer in the face.

After months of questions and rumors, Animal Adventure Park owner Jordan Patch announced Wednesday the news millions of worldwide giraffe fans have been waiting to hear: April the giraffe is pregnant again.

Last month, the park announced it was sending 30 days worth of fecal samples to another zoo's laboratory for progesterone testing to confirm the pregnancy, 14 months after April gave birth to her calf, Tajiri on site at the park.

Keeper Allysa Swilley had collected a fecal sample from April's stall over the course of a month. The samples were secured in plastic bags, labeled and dated before being put in freezer storage.

April is months into her pregnancy and due to give birth in early spring 2019, park officials said.

Last year, Southern Tier residents and others from around the nation and world watched, as the heavily pregnant giraffe captivated audiences on the park's live stream during the final weeks of her pregnancy.

On April 15, 2017, more than a million viewers tuned in to watch April give birth to a healthy, male calf named Tajiri.

“April’s prior pregnancy facilitated an immeasurable amount of education and appreciation for giraffes,"" Patch said in a news release. ""We’re very proud of our captive management and propagation program and eager to continue doing all we can to help bring this species awareness and tangible results towards conservation.”

Fans will once again be able to follow April's progress throughout her pregnancy on social media, the park said.

-954667,Demi Lovato’s Mom Speaks Out After Her Apparent Overdose,"Getty

Nearly two months after Demi Lovato's apparent overdose, her mom, Dianna de la Garza, is breaking her silence.

As for how Demi is doing, Dianna told Newsmax TV, “She's happy. She's healthy. She's working on her sobriety, and she's getting the help she needs. That in itself encourages me about her future and about the future of our family.""

Dianna got permission from Demi before appearing on the news channel where she opened up about her reaction to the apparent overdose. She said, “It's still a really difficult thing to talk about. I literally start to shake a little bit when I start to remember what happened that day.""

Demi's assistant was the one who called Dianna, who “was in shock” over the news. She added, “I didn't know what to say. It was just something that I never, ever expected to hear, as a parent, about any of my kids.""

After learning that Demi was conscious but not talking, Dianna “knew at that point that we were in trouble.”

Dianna and Demi's sisters Dallas and Madison rushed to Cedars-Sinai Hospital to see Demi. She shared, “Dallas and Madison and I jumped out of the car at the emergency room and ran into the emergency room to be by her side. She just didn't look good — at all. She was in bad shape. But I said to her, 'Demi, I'm here. I love you.' And at that point she said back to me, 'I love you, too.'""

De la Garza said she relied on faith to get her through. ""From that point on, I never allowed myself to ever think that things weren't going to be okay,"" she said. ""I prayed, of course, all the way to the hospital, and my faith is strong. I think that was one of things that got me through the next couple of days when she was in critical condition. We just didn't know for two days if she was going to make it or not.""",real

-954818,Here's Everything Leaving Netflix In August (2018) And What You Shouldn't Miss,"Every month a bunch of new TV shows, movies and Netflix Originals land on Netflix. While the latter stays (presumably) forever, non-Netflix content typically has an expiration date.

That's why next month movies like 13 Assassins, The Road and The 40 Year Old Virgin are all on their way out.

If you haven't seen any of those films, do yourself a favor and go watch them. The Road is a pretty dark take on the apocalypse. As in, it's dark even for a post-apocalyptic movie which, by definition, is going to be a little dark. But you can wash off all that grimdark with the fun humor in The 40 Year Old Virgin starring Steve Carell.

Kids take the biggest hit next month, losing Disney/Pixar's Finding Dory, along with seasons of Care Bears, Pound Puppies and Littlest Pet Shop.

For my part, I just really need to watch 13 Assassins which leaves on the 5th. It's been on my watch-list forever, but now that it's leaving Netflix it's time to stop procrastinating.

-954954,Valerie Jarrett responds to Roseanne’s racist Twitter rant: ‘A teaching moment’,"Washington CNN —

Valerie Jarrett, a former top aide to President Barack Obama, reacted to actress Roseanne Barr’s racist Twitter rant that led to the cancellation of the television sitcom “Roseanne” on Tuesday by saying that the incident should become “a teaching moment.”

In one tweet, Barr wrote, “Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj” in reference to Jarrett. ABC announced it was canceling “Roseanne” in the aftermath of the Twitter outburst.

Jarrett said on MSNBC she is “fine” but feels concerned for people without “friends and followers who come right to their defense” who experience “ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.”

“I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment,” Jarrett said. “I’m fine. I’m worried about all the people out there who don’t have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense. The person who is walking down the street minding their own business and they see somebody cling to their purse, or run across the street, or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation – the talk – as we call it. As you say, those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.”

Barr, who has since apologized to Jarrett on Twitter, is facing intense backlash for her comments.

In a statement announcing the cancellation of her sitcom, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said, “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.”",real

3:55 PM PT -- Trump's star has been vandalized AGAIN, and this time it's a bloody mess. Someone poured paint -- or something that looks like fake blood -- all over the President's plaque on the Walk of Fame.

Play video content TMZ.com

As we told you, we have a fixed camera across the street, and it captured footage of the culprit in action. The man appears to have been part of a PETA protest going down outside a retail store next to the star.

It didn't take long this time around for someone to start cleaning it up. It appears the swastikas from Wednesday morning had just been scrubbed before this latest incident.

Play video content 12/20/18 TMZ.com

Some guy vandalized Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with swastikas ... and we got him on camera doing it.

TMZ captured the crime in progress through our live stream feed on Hollywood Blvd., and you can see a man dressed in black bend down and scribble all over Trump's star. Mind you, this was done Wednesday morning around 9 AM PT ... in broad daylight.

You can see, it's already starting to fade.

The culprit does the deed quickly as people walk right by him without batting an eyelash, but two women seem to notice the tagging as he walks away. There appears to be a written message, too, using a Spanish language slur -- ""F*** This P**o"" -- and the 2 big swastikas are underneath the words.

We're told no one filed a police report about the vandalism. Of course, this is just the latest hit job the President's star has received over the past couple years.

Most recently, someone drew prison bars over the star (which we also caught on camera) ... and then there was the second pickax incident earlier this summer.",real

“My role is as an executive producer, and I’m working with the writers, with Lily, and talking to the writers,” Fonda told reporters at the Television Critics Association panel. “Right now, Dolly, Lily and I are all intending to be in it.”

The film, said Fonda, will tackle current issues in the workplace like changing technology and corporate voyeurism.

“I’m sorry to say the situation is worse today,” she said. “Today a lot of the workforce is hired by an outside company. Who do you talk to if you have a problem?”

Rumors of a remake swirled earlier this year when it was revealed that Rashida Jones and the original screenwriter, Patricia Resnick, teamed up to co-write a script. At the time, Parton was eager to reprise her role for a follow-up film.

“All these years we’ve talked about doing a sequel to 9 to 5 and it never made any real sense until just recently,” Parton said to Entertainment Weekly previously. “We decided that we are going to do another one. We are trying to get the script and all that, everyone is very interested and we’ve all agreed that we’d love to do it if it’s right.”

-955293,Brooklyn Beckham Photographs 'Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner Sitting On The Toilet,"Updated 10 August: Brooklyn Beckham has proved he's not just a talented photographer but a singer, much like his famous mother.

This morning, the 19-year-old posted a behind-the-scenes video of him on set with Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner for the cover of 1883 magazine.

At the beginning of the clip, the photographer can be heard singing Lil Skies' hit single 'Nowadays' to the camera but wasn't too sure if he was being filmed.

Luckily for us, he was.

He may have quit his university photography course earlier this month, but it appears Brooklyn Beckham is showing no signs of giving up on his passion of working behind the lens.

Last night, the 19-year-old star posted a photograph of the cover of the new 1883 Magazine, featuring Games of Thrones actress Sophie Turner.

In the snap, the 22-year-old is photographed crouching on top of a blue toilet, wearing leather trousers and a printed shirt, carrying a beer bottle.

In another snap, the British-born star shared a behind-the-scenes picture of him cosying up with the GoT star, revealing the close bond they developed on set.

‘Love photographing you for 1883 x such a lovely girl,’ Brooklyn captioned the picture.

Earlier this morning, the budding photographer - who is rumoured to have just scored an internship in the UK with a prestigious photographer - has long professed his love of photography.

‘My dad bought me my first camera when I was 15, a Pentax K1000,’ Brooklyn previously told ET.

On pursuing a career in photography, the teen added: 'My mum was like, ""Do it,""' Brooklyn said. '""If you don’t like it, you can [switch].""'

The star recently took the campaigns shots for his mother’s new Reebok collection.

Over the weekend Victoria posted a series of images shot by her son with the caption: ‘Love seeing my Merch Collection through @BrooklynBeckham eyes’.



Beckham’s big break in fashion came at the age of 16 when he first snapped photos for a Burberry fragrance campaign.

Selena dated Nick from 2008 to 2010, while Taylor dated Joe in 2008—but was notoriously dumped in a phone call months later. Although those relationships didn't last, the one between Selena and Taylor remains stronger than ever.

""We actually dated the Jonas Brothers together! It was hysterical,"" Gomez recalled her first time meeting Swift in a new radio interview with KIIS FM UK.

""It was amazing, because she was the girl with the big curly hair and all the bracelets and the cowboy boots. And I was definitely up-and-coming, and we just clicked,"" she added. ""It was the best thing we got out of those relationships.""

They still keep in touch with the Jonases, however. ""They're lovely, by the way,"" Gomez said. ""We're all friends now. We were young, you know. It's a different time.""

This isn't Gomez's first time opening up about her and Swift's friendship. In March 2016, she said of her fellow star: ""I've known her for 10 years, she's been one of my best friends through thick and thin, walked by my side.""

She added that Swift is ""known for embracing her personal story and creating a beautiful thing out of it, and I was a little hesitant with that—and she was always the person to encourage me to tell my story and be proud of who I am.""

Swift showed the feeling was mutual while speaking to E! in May 2014. ""Both of us have kind of stuck it out and hung in there through all the different changes we've gone through,"" she said. The singer added that their friendship is ""the longest one I think either of us have had.""

-955542,'Nashville' finale: Connie Britton returns as Rayna Jaymes,"On its final episode ""Nashville"" found a way for viewers to see Rayna Jaymes and Deacon Claybourne together again, one last time.

Rayna — played by Connie Britton — was the star of ""Nashville"" for its first 4½ seasons. Midway through season five, the character died after being involved in a grisly car accident, leaving her grieving husband, Deacon (Charles Esten), and their two children behind.

But in the final minutes of Thursday night's series finale, Rayna returned. As Deacon prepares to go on stage at the Ryman Auditorium, he suddenly flashes back to a conversation he had with Rayna on their wedding night.

""Sometimes, once in your life, somebody gets in your bloodstream,"" she tells him. ""It doesn't matter how much you've failed each other. You must choose each other. And I choose you, exactly the way you are. And I'm gonna love you forever.""

""She wanted to do it, and we wanted to do it,"" showrunner Marshall Herskovitz tells The Tennessean.

""And it was great to have her back. I think everybody had a wonderful time those two days, and just having her back brought some closure to the whole experience for everyone who'd been involved. It was very emotional.""

“Rayna got to do the impossible,"" Britton said in a statement shared with The Tennessean. ""She got to come back from the dead ... to go back to my Nashville family and celebrate all the hard work and love and care that went into that show.""

And, while the world already knew that the romance was a whirlwind, Jonas and Chopra have only just divulged the details of how they got together, including the incredibly romantic way they got engaged.



In a new interview with American Vogue, Jonas explained that he proposed to Chopra after just three dates, but a year and a half after meeting.

The couple first set eyes on one another at the Vanity Fair Oscar's party in 2017, where Jonas apparently got on one knee and said: ""You’re real. Where have you been all my life?""

The singer explains that the couple then texted for a while, before choosing to attend the Met Gala together in May, where they were both dressed in Ralph Lauren and posed on the red carpet, although not as a couple.

Jonas and Chopra then didn't see each other for an entire year, until they ran into one another on the 2018 Met Gala red carpet. After this, things moved quickly.

Three dates in and Jonas called Chopra's mother to inform her that he was going to propose. The singer shut down a Tiffany & Co store in London so that he could pick out the perfect ring and then whisked her off to Crete for her birthday. Jonas explained that he waited until midnight to propose, so that their engagement anniversary would not cross over with her birthday celebrations.

""I got down on one knee, again, and I said: 'Will you make me the happiest man in the world and marry me?' No joke — she took about 45 seconds. 45 seconds of silence.""

He then said: ""I’m going to put this ring on your finger now unless you have any objections.""



The sweet proposal has been followed by a few months of wedding planning, which will result in a three-day celebration in India, with two ceremonies taking place.

The Oscar-winning actress was surrounded by her loved ones as she attended a dinner for twelve in her honor at celebrity-haunt Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills on Thursday, July 26.

-955437,Meghan Markle Reportedly Approves of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas' Engagement,"Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas are reportedly engaged after two months of dating. And though the news may come as a surprise to many, it seems the couple has the approval of one of the actress' famous friends: Meghan Markle.

The Duchess of Sussex is ""very excited"" for the couple, a source told E! News. ""Everyone is very happy and they are definitely a great match,"" the insider added of the duo's inner circle.





Markle herself was engaged to Prince Harry in November and tied the knot in May. Chopra, one of her longtime friends, attended both the star-studded wedding at Windsor Castle and the exclusive evening reception at Frogmore House.

If there's any chance the Duchess will attend Chopra and Jonas' rumored nuptials, she should take a note from her fellow actress' style book when it comes to wedding-guest dressing. Chopra wore a lavender Vivienne Westwood suit for the ceremony and a stunning sparkly Dior gown for the afterparty.

Though Priyanka attended the royal wedding alone, we hope Meghan goes the opposite route and brings Prince Harry when it's her turn to play wedding guest.



Jonas popped the question to Chopra last week in London around the time of her 36th birthday, People reports. The singer was so intent on finding the right engagement ring that he reportedly closed down a whole Tiffany & Co. store so he could pick one out.

The two jumped from a plane at 15,000 feet.

Tom Cruise is no stranger to dangerous stunts, but the same can't be said for ""The Late Late Show"" host James Corden. For his latest stunt, Cruise brought Corden along with him: skydiving at 15,000 feet for a ""Late Late Show"" segment on Thursday.

It was almost an impossible mission, though. Corden joked that he tried to reach Cruise multiple times to cancel.

Before they got in the air, Corden was his usual comedic self, asking Cruise if there was ""meal service"" on the plane and coming up with a hand signal for if he soiled himself. When Corden met the professional that he'd be diving with, Danny, who was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, he said, ""We're not skydiving into Margaritaville, I want someone who looks like they know what they're doing.""

But Danny had dived 7,000 times already, which promptly reassured Corden.

Cruise, meanwhile, took it all in stride. The actor skydived for a scene in ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout,"" and he jumped out of a plane 106 times at 30,000 feet for the shot. He even slept on the plane as it ascended while Corden sat nervously waiting.

Before they dived, Corden called his wife, and Cruise said he would take care of her if Corden dies. She joked that it would be a ""better life.""

She's stuck with Corden, though, as they finally jumped and reached the ground.

July 28 (UPI) -- The Los Angeles County District Attorney has declined to prosecute Gossip Girl alum Ed Westwick after several women accused him last fall of sexually assaulting them in 2014. E! News said investigations were conducted, but two of the cases were dropped due to insufficient evidence and a third because the alleged victim was unavailable to be interviewed. Advertisement

Westwick, 31, denied any wrongdoing at the time he was accused.

""The evidence was clear from the start that each of the allegations made by these three women were absolutely untrue,"" the actor's attorney Blair Berk told TMZ on Friday. ""It is a shame there are those who prejudged this case and that it took over eight months for Ed to be officially cleared of all of these charges. I hope that those who made such quick judgment here not knowing anything about the abundant evidence of innocence in this case will hesitate next time before they so publicly accuse someone who has committed no wrongdoing.""

Westwick was fired from the BBC/Amazon adaptation of Agatha Christie's mystery Ordeal By Innocence in January due to the allegations and was replaced by actor Christian Cooke.

-955706,Star Wars: Episode IX will feature unseen footage of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia,"Spoiler warning for anyone who hasn’t seen The Last Jedi, though, if you still haven’t at this point, what are you even doing reading casting announcements for the next one?

No one ever really dies in the Star Wars universe. The official cast list for Star Wars: Episode IX has been posted, and it features some familiar, intriguing names. Along with the long-awaited return of Billy Dee Williams as Lando, Carrie Fisher is listed among the names.

Fisher sadly passed away in late-2016, of course, but Princess Leia Organa will be returning for one last film. Rather than recreating the character with CGI, however, director/co-writer J.J. Abrams will be resurfacing unseen footage from The Force Awakens.

“We desperately loved Carrie Fisher,” Abrams said in a press release tied to the announcement. “Finding a truly satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga without her eluded us. We were never going to recast, or use a CG character. With the support and blessing from her daughter, [Billie Lourd], we have found a way to honor Carrie’s legacy and role as Leia in Episode IX by using unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII.”

Meet the cast of Star Wars: Episode IX. Beginning filming next week.https://t.co/BUCl4H8aRT pic.twitter.com/ezEaLzijLq — Star Wars (@starwars) July 27, 2018

Rogue One, of course, took a slightly uncanny valley approach to recreating a young Leia with actress Ingvild Deila and a little bit of the old Industrial Light & Magic.

Also returning is Mark Hamill. Given how things worked out for him during The Last Jedi, however, it’s hard to say if he’ll be doing so as a translucent blue ghost. We’ll have to wait until December 2019 to know for sure.

Cast members Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran and Joonas Suotamo will be returning, as well.",real

-955779,Taylor Swift Gave Free Tickets To Police And Firefighters After A Tragedy,"Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” tour stopped in Massachusetts this past weekend to play a three-night set in Gillette Stadium, and most of the buzz surrounding the concerts had to do with a few of her more famous fans (Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively were seen dancing, while Gigi Hadid just lost her fan-girl mind). But there were hundreds of other fans in the stadium over the weekend who didn’t get the same attention but probably should have.

So, Swift gave hundreds of free tickets to local police officers and firefighters following the tragic death of Weymouth Sgt. Michael Chesna, who was shot and killed on July 15. The Patriot Ledger reported that Swift sent the town “a significant number of tickets” to her concert. And it was a hard ticket to get.

“The gesture was absolutely generous, significant and appreciated,” Weymouth Mayor Robert Hedlund told the Ledger, adding that Swift didn’t do it for the press. Sure enough, Swift’s camp hasn’t said anything about the gesture when asked by the local media.

“My understanding is that they did it low-key and weren’t looking for publicity,” Hedlund said. “There were enough to send every police officer, firefighter and extended family to the concert, and then some.”

It’s a classy gesture by Swift for a grieving community and a great way to honor the men and women who serve.

Plus, as an added bonus, it meant that if she got stuck up in a basket again there were fans who work in law enforcement there to help her. Maybe one of those fire trucks with the really big ladder.

Now, we just have to try and find out if anybody has video of the police officers and firefighters freaking out like Hadid. I mean, really Gigi…

Then again, it was a pretty big deal: Swift is the first female to ever play Gillette.

“Getting to play here 1 time is insane. Getting to play here twice is insane. This is our 3rd night in a row playing at Gillette Stadium. Because of you, you’ve made tonight the very 1st time a female artist has played 3 nights at Gillette Stadium.” –@taylorswift13 — Gillette Stadium (@GilletteStadium) July 29, 2018

Last week, Michelle Williams revealed in a profile for Vanity Fair’s September issue that she recently married musician Phil Elverum, of Mount Eerie, in a secret ceremony in the Adirondacks. And in an interview with Australia’s Sydney Morning Herald this weekend, Heath Ledger’s father, Kim, said he and his family are “terribly happy” for Williams.

“She’s very private and I don’t really like to make too many comments about her, but we are very happy [for her],” Kim Ledger told the paper. He added that while he did not attend the couple’s wedding in July, he was planning on visiting them in Brooklyn “soon.”

Williams and Ledger dated from 2005 to 2007, separating shortly before Ledger’s death. They had a daughter together, Matilda, who’s now 12. Like Williams, Elverum is also a single parent who lost his partner to tragedy. He has a daughter, Agathe, 3, whose mother, artist Geneviève Castrée passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2015, just over a year after giving birth.

“Ultimately the way he loves me is the way I want to live my life on the whole,” Williams told Vanity Fair. “I work to be free inside of the moment. I parent to let Matilda feel free to be herself, and I am finally loved by someone who makes me feel free.”",real

However, unlike the rest of us, they're actually friends with the former talk-show host and media titan. And while that may sound like something to brag about to you and me, it sparked a battle on Thursday's ""Ellen DeGeneres Show.""

The problem? It's great to be her friend, but it's even better to be her best friend — and there can be only one, evidently.

""(Reese) somehow claims that just because she was in that movie ('A Wrinkle in Time') with you that she's your best friend,"" DeGeneres noted, having made a similar claim concerning her own closeness to Winfrey.

But all of that talk simply left Oprah wondering, ""Why do we have to have a better or a best?""

Meanwhile DeGeneres preferred to focus on her own question: Who deserves the coveted BFF title?

Michael Rozman/ Warner Bros.

To settle the matter once and for all, the host brought out Witherspoon for an Oprah Winfrey trivia showdown. Whoever could answer the most Oprah-related tidbits correctly — such as what her fellow high school students voted her ""most likely to ..."" or her secret ingredient to a great margarita — would win.

Alas, they got both of those questions wrong. The answers were ""most popular"" and ""fresh-squeezed limes,"" respectively.

""So far, I have no friends,"" Winfrey quipped. ""I have none.""

Not so!

Before the bid was over, Witherspoon and DeGeneres managed to get a couple of answers right, with DeGeneres taking the lead by one — thanks, in part, to the fact that she knew which 1990s sitcom Oprah played a therapist on; It was none other than ""Ellen.""

-915892,Josh Duhamel Defends Ex Fergie's National Anthem Performance,"Josh Duhamel and Fergie have split, but the actor still has his ex’s back.

On Friday’s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Duhamel defends Fergie’s controversial performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the NBA All-Star Game.

“She’s been slammed and hammered for this national anthem,” DeGeneres says of the sultry rendition, which was harpooned on social media.

“I think that she would probably admit that it was not her best work. But the girl’s crazy-talented, she really is. And she’s an amazing woman, an amazing human being,” says Duhamel, 45, of Fergie, 42, with whom he shares custody of their 4-year-old son Axl. (The former couple announced their separation after eight years of marriage in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE in September.)

“It’s hard to see someone you care about get beat up like that. But that’s the business — you’re in this business, and you put yourself out there; sometimes you win, and sometimes you don’t,” he adds.

The actor says the singer is unfazed by the backlash. After all, big girls don’t cry.

“Trust me, she’s fine,” he says. “She is about as resilient as they come.”

The day after the All-Star game, Fergie opened up about her polarizing performance.

“I’ve always been honored and proud to perform the national anthem and last night I wanted to try something special for the NBA,” she told PEOPLE. “I’m a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn’t strike the intended tone. I love this country and honestly tried my best.”

-916060,Emily Ratajkowski Shuts Down Critics Who Say Her Marriage Won't Last,"When Emily Ratajkowski made the surprise announcement in February that she married film producer Sebastian Bear-McClard in a secret City Hall ceremony, she wasn't entirely showered with congratulations.

""People came after my marriage, like, ‘Wow. I give it three weeks.’ I’m like, ‘What?’"" the 26-year-old model said in an interview with Janet Mock for her new Marie Claire cover story.

Ratajkowski, a vocal feminist, continued: ""No one can take women seriously on any choices that they make, especially if they’re unique to them and they don’t play into the way we think women should get married. It’s a constant writing-off.""

Ratajkowski and Bear-McClard exchanged vows in a civil ceremony in New York City on February 23, in the company of their close group of friends. The low-key nuptials shocked seemed to come out of left field, since the news came weeks after it was speculated that she and longtime boyfriend Jeff Magid split.

There were also no official reports that she and McClard were officially dating, but the couple had known each other for years and were in the same friend group prior to getting romantic, a source assured to People.

Ratajkowski first considered keeping the whole wedding under wraps, but her publicist convinced her to be the one to break the story. The model did just that—in the most casual way possible—first with a few updates on her Instagram story. ""Sooo, I have a surprise, I got married today,"" she announced in a series of photos.

The newlyweds' wedding story was sweetly unconventional, from Bear-McClard's proposal with a paper clip (yes, really) to Ratajkowski's mustard yellow bridal look.

It returned for one day in 2017, inspired by the show ""Rick and Morty,"" and heavy demand led to riots

The chain will also bring back the minty green Shamrock Shake, an annual tie-in to St. Patrick's Day

America, if you like oddly colored but strangely tasty semi-liquid products, today is your day.

McDonald's said Thursday it will bring back Szechuan Sauce, the dipping sauce that caused riots over its one-day availability last October. It will also bring back the Shamrock Shake, its minty seasonal favorite.

The chain will ship 20 million packets of the spicy, salty sauce to stores, starting next week. It announced the release on a new website that also features a three-part podcast series on the public's obsession with the chicken tender companion.

The sauce has its own backstory - it was a limited-time promotional tie-in for the movie ""Mulan"" in 1998. The animated series ""Rick and Morty"" features a character who fawns over the condiment, which led to a petition for the Golden Arches to bring it back.

Never one to miss a good promo, McDonald's brought it back for one day last year - but badly underestimated demand, which led to furious crowds that in some places required police intervention.

""We want to make this right,"" the chain tweeted on Oct. 8, promising to bring the sauce back in greater quantities soon.

""I was all about doing the triple axel or the triple-triple, and now you can do the triple-triple and still get the same points that you would for the triple axel. So, why do the triple axel?""

Harding was the first American woman to successfully do a triple axel in a competition, and recalls the moment she knew she landed the move. ""I was like, 'Yes! I did this!'"" she says. ""I competed for me but I performed for the people.""

Harding also remembers being at the Olympics and thinking, ""Holy crap.""

""Then you have to remember to bring yourself back down to a level that this is just another competition,"" she explains. ""You're like that for a bit and then you start to look around and you're like, 'Holy crap, this is the Olympics.'""

Harding has found herself back in the limelight this year after the success of the movie I, Tonya, which is about her life as a figure skater. She tells DeGeneres that she's quite happy with how the film turned out.

""I achieved something in my life that meant something,"" she says. ""With the new movie, it actually made my life feel like it was worth something.""

Dane, 45, also cited irreconcilable differences and requested to pay spousal support to Gayheart, 46.

Earlier this month, PEOPLE confirmed that the couple — who wed Aug. 29. 2004 — had decided to end their marriage of 14 years after Gayheart, best known for films such as Jawbreaker and Scream 2, had filed.

“After 14 years together we have decided that ending our marriage is the best decision for our family,” Dane, 45, said in a statement to PEOPLE. “We will continue our friendship and work as a team to co-parent our two beautiful girls as they are the most important thing in the world to us.

PEOPLE actually followed up with their own report shortly after with sources refuting the breakup claims, saying that Ewan and Mary were still together, no split.

Ewan and Mary were seen holding hands on the set of her new film this week – Daily Mail has the exclusive photos. Clearly not broken up then. Which most likely means that he and his estranged wife Eve Mavrakis will move ahead with the divorce. When those breakup reports initially surfaced, Eve said that they’re not speaking and that whether or not the breakup rumours were true, she wouldn’t change her mind. We talk about acrimonious divorces a lot on The Social. People keep coming back to “get along for the kids’ sake”. And I get that, I do. That that should be the priority. But it also requires a lot from the person who’s betrayed. Like A LOT. When you “get along for the kids”, often most of the sacrifice comes from one person. Marriages run their course. But bitterness has to run its course too. I’m a bitter ass person. My bitterness would probably run longer than the actual marriage.

The #MeToo edition of the game finds the actresses trying to guess the Hollywood or media power player accused of sexual misconduct. Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer, Louis C.K., Terry Richardson, and Mario Batali are a few of the familiar faces on the game board.

“Did your person prey on men?” Wood asks. “Not this time,” Tran responds. Wood then proceeds to rule out Spacey.

“There are so many cases of sexual harassment, that they update a new deck every 10 hours,” Randolph says, joining the game.

The video ends with a public service announcement encouraging support for Rise, a nonprofit organization that aims to defend the civil rights of sexual assault survivors. The PSA was released in tandem with a hearing held on Capitol Hill for the implementation of the Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act. Wood, Rise CEO and founder Amanda Nguyen, and Rise chief of staff Lauren Libby will attend the hearing to testify on behalf of sexual assault survivors nationwide.

“I wanted to participate in Rise’s PSA to help harness the power of the #MeToo movement into concrete action,” Wood said. “If you are fired up, angry, or feel helpless, join the Rise movement to help protect the rights of sexual assault survivors across the country.”

In 2016, Rise worked toward passing legislation that led to the creation of the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights.

“As the national conversation continues around the #MeToo movement, we want to give survivors and allies a way to take action to protect the rights of rape survivors everywhere, regardless of geography, race, or economics,” Nguyen said. “We are thankful for the support of Evan, Kelly, Da’Vine, Tatiana, and the Funny or Die team to build the Rise movement across the country with the goal of passing the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights in every state.”

An all-female crew, featuring director Veronica Rodriguez, writer Tamara Yajia, and executive producer Kate Lilly, created the PSA.",real
-916902,Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway to present best picture Oscar again,"At the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway are getting a mulligan: the Bonnie and Clyde pair will present the Oscar for best picture again, one year after they infamously announced La La Land, instead of the actual winner, Moonlight.

Last year Beatty and Dunaway presented the night’s top honor to mark the 50th anniversary of Bonnie and Clyde. When Beatty hesitated to announce the winner, visibly confused by the contents on the card, Dunaway read off La La Land as best picture. The mistake was attributed to the accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who mixed up the envelope for best actress, won by La La Land’s Emma Stone, with that of best picture.

For several minutes the mistake went unaccounted for, as the cast of La La Land gave speeches on the stage. Then, producer Jordan Horowitz corrected the record, telling the the audience there had been a mistake and that Moonlight had won the award.

This year, the Academy has streamlined its processes to prevent another mistake. But Beatty and Dunaway, evidently, will get a second chance to announce the prestigious award. On Thursday evening, TMZ learned that the two were spotted rehearsing at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, where Dunaway said “presenting is better the second time around”. Beatty replied: “The winner is Gone with the Wind.”

Other confirmed presenters during this year’s telecast include Sandra Bullock, Lupita Nyong’o, Emily Blunt, Armie Hammer, Tiffany Haddish, Jodie Foster and Gal Gadot, while the ceremony will again be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.

Ivan died last Wednesday after coming down with Parvovirus, a virus common to dogs which is fatal roughly 80 percent of the time, according to Wikipedia.

Winfrey adopted Ivan and his sister, Sadie, and actually introduced Sadie on the March 6 “Oprah” episode.

Sadie is currently being treated as a precaution because she was exposed to Ivan, according to peoplepets.com, which broke the story.

Winfrey has lost several dogs the past few years; Gracie, her golden retriever, died in 2007 after choking on a ball.

-917178,See Inside Gwen Stefani's Over-The-Top Beverly Hills Mansion,"Gwen Stefani is having a hard-time selling the mega mansion she shared with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale — possibly because it’s not for the faint of heart (or the shallow of wallet).

Simon Berlyn

According to Variety, the former couple purchased the 11,845-square-foot Beverly Hills estate for $13.25 million in 2006 and listed it in 2016 for $35 million following their divorce. Stefani dropped the asking price to $29 million earlier this year.

Simon Berlyn

Designer Kelly Wearstler lent her trademark glam to the 10-bedroom house, which is a whirlwind of marble facades, graphic patterns, and neon colors. The decor ranges from Hollywood regency to space age to ultra modern. Floor-to-ceiling windows look out onto the San Fenando valley, and vaulted ceilings, skylights, and hardwood flooring complete the package.

Simon Berlyn

Six of the bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms, and the master bedroom boasts a walk-in closet with chic carpeting and wood paneling. The black-and-white striped kitchen is a true show stopper though, with hidden storage space and an adjoining breakfast room with a built-in leather banquette.

Jennifer Lopez also once owned the estate, which checks off the necessary criteria of a celebrity home in Cali: a home gym and screening room, thick hedges shielding the pool from view, a 250-foot private driveway, and a gated entry to keep the paps at bay.

Simon Berlyn

The backyard area is also nicer than most tropical resorts, complete with an infinity pool, a full tennis court, chicken coop, detached guest house, and a playground for Stefani’s children. If you need further proof that Stefani lived here, just take in the statement outdoor pizza oven.

Tarantino, who is writing and directing, describes the project as “a story that takes place in Los Angeles in 1969, at the height of hippy Hollywood.

DiCaprio will play Rick Dalton, former star of a western TV series, while Pitt will be his longtime stunt double, Cliff Booth.

“Both are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don’t recognize anymore. But Rick has a very famous next-door neighbor…Sharon Tate,” Tarantino added.

“I’ve been working on this script for five years, as well as living in Los Angeles County most of my life, including in 1969, when I was 7 years old,” Tarantino said in a statement. “I’m very excited to tell this story of an L.A., and a Hollywood that don’t exist anymore. And I couldn’t be happier about the dynamic teaming of DiCaprio & Pitt as Rick & Cliff.”

Tarantino previously worked with Pitt in “Inglourious Basterds,” which was nominated for eight Academy Awards. DiCaprio starred in the Tarantino’s “Django Unchained,” which scored five Oscar nods.

The film will be released worldwide on August 9, 2019. Opening on the 50th anniversary of the day that the Manson family committed the LaBianca murders and the day after Tate was killed, the film will head off against “Artemis Fowl,” Disney’s adaptation of the popular sci-fi and fantasy series.

Originally shot in 2006, the conversation between Mr. Simpson and the publishing magnate Judith Regan was intended then to promote the ReganBooks release of “If I Did It,” described as a “hypothetical” explanation of how the N.F.L. Hall of Famer might have murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman — a crime for which he was acquitted in 1995.

Lawrence and Aronofsky, 49, began dating after the production of mother!, which he wrote and directed. They later broke up, after a year together, but it seems the two are still close. About a month after they ended their relationship, Lawrence and Aronofsky were seen taking a (friendly) walk in New York City.

Lawrence clearly wasn't offended by Schumer's joke considering she was at her friend and soon-to-be fictional sister's wedding. ""It was beautiful,"" Lawrence said about the event.

-917591,"Katie Couric recounts facing sexist attitudes, comments","CINCINNATI (AP) — Veteran TV journalist Katie Couric recounted Thursday facing demeaning descriptions and “gross comments” during her career.

Couric spoke at consumer products maker Procter & Gamble’s Cincinnati headquarters in a forum on the state of women in the workplace. The #WeSeeEqual forum took place amid a wave of sexual misconduct claims against prominent figures in entertainment, politics and the media — including her former NBC “Today Show” co-host, Matt Lauer.

“I’ve been very fortunate in terms of not being subjected to a lot of sexual misconduct, but certainly I have been subjected to widely held attitudes about women, about compartmentalizing women,” Couric said when asked about career obstacles by Carolyn Tastad, president of P&G’s North America business group, in the forum’s keynote discussion.

Couric cited the frequent descriptions of her as “cute” and “perky,” which she found “marginalizing.” She joked that on her tombstone, it will say “Perky No More.”

She also recalled public critiques of her clothing when she began hosting “CBS Evening News,” and a jarring moment early in her career when she walked into a meeting at CNN and an executive said of her to others around the table: “She’s successful because of her hard work, intelligence and breast size.”

Couric said with support from her supervisor, a male anchor, she wrote to the executive and he soon called her, “dripping with apologies.”

Couric described the #MeToo movement as like “a long-dormant volcano that’s erupting” and said it’s important for men to be part of open discussions on gender issues, on how to make things better. But she said she thinks it “just feels almost too red-hot” for some to have such discussions publicly yet.

Couric has said she had been unaware of the misconduct allegations that led to Lauer’s ouster last year.

For the first time, nearly everyone in Hollywood agreed that the red carpet could be a place to bring attention to real feats of activism.

Peter Lee Thomas has been working with Halle for about two years, and told People she’s super committed to fitness.

“I had no idea what her age was when I met her. I never looked or was interested in that, and when I found out, I was absolutely shell-shocked because she has the discipline and athleticism of a 25-year old.""

So, Thomas did what any good trainer would do, and decided to challenge Halle even more, with a combination of exercises like martial arts, boxing, yoga and “a lot of military training [like] the Navy Seals would do.”

In fact, Halle is so awesome at working out, that Thomas said she could “very easily transition” into becoming a professional athlete if she wanted to.

“She’s also not afraid to experiment and explore and take risks when it comes to fitness,"" Thomas said, ""because she understands that in order for there to be potential growth and change, she’s going to have to do things that are commonly difficult to do.""

Thomas, who trains Halle five days a week, revealed to People he surprises her with something new every day. “I bring a constellation of things,” he said. “That, in itself, is quite challenging because she has to be ready almost on improv. It can break a lot of people, who don’t see the workout the day prior.”

Of course, what she eats matters, too. According to Thomas, Halle follows the keto diet.

And based on her social media presence, Halle is proud of what she can do. She offers up her own weekly #FitnessFriday workout tips on Instagram, like the importance of stretching:

It may not have been an Oscar, but Dwayne Johnson graciously accepted the award anyway.

“The Rock” posted a video Sunday on Instagram accepting a Razzie for last year’s “Baywatch.” The Golden Raspberry Awards, known as the Razzies, celebrate the best of the worst in Hollywood.

Along with the video, the star wrote, “So let me go ahead and take this “L” right on the chin for Baywatch. Win some, lose some, but hey… that’s the way love goes.”

“Happy Oscars Sunday!” he said in the video. “I’m super pumped and very proud for my buddies who’ve been nominated tonight, pulling for you guys to bring home the gold. I’m also excited because I was just informed that I too am bringing home the gold tonight.”

“No, not an Oscar, maybe one day, but a Razzie,” Johnson added.

“Baywatch” even inspired a new category: “The Razzie Nominee So Bad You Loved It.”

Johnson called the special honor a “cool thing” and said “it means the s**t sandwich you have been eating is so bad that you eventually started to like it.”

“Look, we made Baywatch with the best of intentions,” he said. “It didn’t work out like that, but I humbly and graciously accept my Razzie.”

The actor thanked his fans and critics.

“At the end of the day ‘A Movie So Rotten You Eventually Fell in Love With It,’ that’s just the way love goes,” he said.

Inspired by the popular TV series, the film with Johnson and Zac Efron proved to be all wet at the box office, pleasing neither moviegoers or critics.

The resulting bow-trimmed gown, coupled with Ronan’s new cropped hair, is poised to sit alongside other memorable Oscar red carpet moments, including Nicole Kidman’s mandarin-inspired Galliano for Dior couture dress in 1997 and Julia Roberts’s black and white Valentino stunner from 2001. “I want this to be timeless,” said Saltzman. “It needed to be about Saoirse, as a person.” It also functioned as Simons’s statement on elegance, femininity, and what it means to dress as a woman on the awards show circuit. “It’s what girls are made of, and what women can wear,” said Saltzman. “It’s just so beautiful.”",real

It’s part of the journey to success, certainly, but that doesn’t make it any less sad for the 22-year-old actor, who had a minor role in the 2014 blockbuster Interstellar starring Matthew McConaughey.

In a conversation with fellow star Emma Stone, 30, for Variety’s Actors on Actors franchise, which will air on PBS in January, the Call Me By Your Name lead recalled his reaction to watching an early screening of Christopher Nolan’s film with the cast, which included A-listers like Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway.

“I forgot about this — I really haven’t thought about this moment until right now,” he reminisced with a smile on his face. “It was surreal because it’s a huge IMAX theater … and I really had no career at this point, so I was like the fraud a little bit in the room.”

The Oscar nominee continued: “I saw it, and I loved it, but I went home to my dad and wept for an hour because I just figured my part was bigger. They didn’t even cut anything. I just figured — I don’t know what I figured.”

Of course, the New York City native has secured much more substantial roles since then. Shortly after his feature film debut in Jason Reitman’s drama Men, Women & Children, he gained recognition for his supporting role in Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird, which was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture. Chalamet also acted in another 2018 Academy favorite, Call Me By Your Name, for which he received his first nomination.

-918290,Oscars 2018: Jordan Peele Wins an Oscar and Makes History,"It only took one film for Jordan Peele to become an Oscar winner. On Sunday night, the writer-director picked up the best-original-screenplay statuette for Get Out, the social thriller that dominated the awards cycle for its acute commentary on race in America. He is the first black screenwriter to win an award in this category.

“This means so much to me,” Peele said. “I stopped writing this movie about 20 times because I thought it was impossible.”

He continued, saying that he eventually persevered because he knew that if it did get made, “people would hear it and people would see it.”

“I want to dedicate this to all the people who raised my voice,” he said, thanking fans, Universal, and Blumhouse. He also thanked his wife, the comedian Chelsea Peretti, “who supported me through this whole process,” and his mother, “who taught me to love, even in the face of hate.”

Once backstage, he tweeted something a little less formal:

Peele’s Get Out was up against The Big Sick, Lady Bird, The Shape of Water, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Get Out, thanks to its pop-culture appeal and astounding social relevance, was an early front-runner, and was nominated for four awards overall: best picture, best director (for Peele), best original screenplay (Peele), and best actor (Daniel Kaluuya).

Back when it was released last February, the film quickly picked up steam and punctured the zeitgeist, morphing from a well-received low-budget horror hit to a serious awards-season contender. Peele has spent the last few months stumping for the film and picking up barrels of awards from various critics circles and the Directors Guild of America. The social thriller, about a black man who visits his white girlfriend’s family and discovers that things are not all they seem, resonated with audiences and made about $255 million worldwide.

Before presenting Best Actress alongside Jennifer Lawrence at the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday night, the 55-year-old actress hobbled onto the stage with a pair of crutches and a boot, joking that Streep had “I, Tonya’ed” her, although she preferred “not to discuss it.”

Foster’s representative told TheWrap that Foster fell while skiing a few weeks ago, which is why she needed crutches.

Foster and Lawrence presented the coveted award to Frances McDormand for her role in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” During her acceptance speech, McDormand asked every single other female Oscar nominee to stand up alongside her and asked for producers to tell and finance their stories.

She also mentioned the Inclusion Rider, something people working in film can include in their contracts. The clause can be added to contracts for actors and others working on a movie, requiring that the movie’s producers hire a diverse cast and crew. If the movie wasn’t diverse, it would give the actor a legal reason to back out of the contract — meaning the rider could have a serious effect on all the hiring practices on a film.",real

-918582,Seth MacFarlane on the one ‘big problem’ with the Oscars,"The stars were out to play as the 90th Academy Awards didn’t disappoint, from joke to pranks to powerful speeches, it had it all and took home the Oscar for Best Picture

FAMILY Guy creator and one-time Academy Awards host Seth MacFarlane has spoken out about what he sees as the “big problem” with the Oscars following yesterday’s ceremony.

MacFarlane, who drew mixed responses when he hosted the 2013 Oscars, tweeted his thoughts after a ceremony yesterday that saw fantasy film The Shape Of Water and dramas like Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri and The Darkest Hour take home many of the major awards.

MacFarlane’s issue with the Oscars is the lack of acknowledgment for excellent comedy films.

“Here’s another big problem with the Oscars no one talks about: It’s 99% drama. Until a movie like Bridesmaids or Airplane! gets a Best Picture win or even a nomination, it’s all conspicuously incomplete. Get Out is a breath of fresh air to be sure, but it’s the exception,” he tweeted.

Horror film Get Out won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay yesterday — and some on Twitter were quick to point out that in fact, Bridesmaids scored two nominations back at the 84th Oscars, one for Best Supporting Actress and another for Best Original Screenplay.

MacFarlane also provided examples of comedies over the years that have deserved a Best Picture nod, nominating Arthur, Tootsie, Little Shop of Horrors, Groundhog Day and Back to the Future as worthy contenders.

When one follower pointed out that at least two of this year’s Best Picture nominees, Lady Bird and Three Billboards, had comedic elements, MacFarlane tweeted: “Comedic elements for sure, but still a dramatic story first. Im talking about an unabashed comedy.”

Comedy winners of the Best Picture Oscar have indeed been few and far between over the years, but include musical comedy Going My Way in 1944, Woody Allen rom-com Annie Hall in 1977 and silent film The Artist in 2011.",real

""I really wanted everyone to know that this was on me. This was my fault, and I felt like filming that would let people know that, that if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup. And I wanted her that opportunity, honestly, I wanted her that opportunity to be the potential Bachelorette.""

And for me, there was a lot of pressure on that day, being the Bachelor, and to propose, that’s sort of what’s expected in a way,” he told host Michael Strahan. “I was really conflicted, and I felt in the moment that was the right decision, and it honestly wasn’t.” He said he started to regret his decision right after getting home from Peru, where the proposal was filmed. “In hindsight, no, I shouldn’t have proposed,” Arie said.

He told Strahan he hadn’t seen Becca since their breakup, until he apologized to her on After the Final Rose. “I hope I gave her a little bit of closure,” he said. “I’m very happy for her, I’m happy that she’s going to be able to find her true love through the show.”

Mark Hamill, the legendary actor who portrayed Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars saga — and whose incredible body of work spans movies, TV, theatre, video games, and voice-over — received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today, which has been dubbed #JediDay. The accolade was dedicated in a ceremony at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, featuring Star Wars creator George Lucas and fellow Star Wars icon Harrison Ford, who delivered fun and touching tributes to their friend and collaborator.

“I’m very proud of Mark for getting this star,” Lucas said. “You’ve come a long way from that [Star Wars] casting session…to getting your star on Hollywood Boulevard.”

In preparing for the event, Ford went back and watched their original screen test. “He had just the right blend of youthfulness and enthusiasm,” he said. Continuing, Ford expressed his joy for Hamill. “He is, as he always was, a quiet, sincere, honest person…I’m happy for ya, pal.”

Finally, Hamill addressed the many fans in attendance. “Words truly fail me. It’s hard to convey my gratitude, my joy, the exhilaration of being recognized this way,” he said. “I haven’t been this speechless since The Force Awakens.” Hamill thanked Lucas, Ford, Disney, and his family, and recounted his journey from childhood puppet shows to working actor. But he saved a special tribute for the Star Wars faithful.

“You are with me through thick and thin, and the highs and lows, and everywhere in between,” he said. “From Jedi to Joker and back again, it’s been a fantastic ride. Thank you so much, and may the Force be with each and every one of you.”

Hamill receives his star as Star Wars: The Last Jedi arrives on Digital on March 13, and on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and On-Demand on March 27.

Or maybe he'll do both.

Talks are underway between Obama and Netflix (NFLX), according to a source familiar with the discussions.

The source characterized it as a ""production partnership"" and said the deal has not been finalized yet.

If it happens, both the former president and his wife, Michelle, will be involved in a series of shows for Netflix.

It would be a triumph for the streaming service, providing the kind of exclusive programming that sells subscriptions. And it would give the Obamas a platform to reach a huge audience around the world.

Netflix says it has more than 117 million subscribers, 55 million of whom are in the United States.

A Netflix spokesman declined to comment on Thursday.

News of the talks was first reported by The New York Times. ""The number of episodes and the formats for the shows have not been decided,"" The Times said.

The newspaper described two potential shows. In one, ""Mr. Obama could moderate conversations on topics that dominated his presidency."" Another show ""could feature Mrs. Obama on topics, like nutrition, that she championed in the White House.""

Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama, said in a statement Thursday night that the Obamas ""have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire.""

While he did not comment directly on the Netflix talks, he said the Obamas ""continue to explore new ways to help others tell and share their stories.""

In the final days of the Obama administration, it was reported that Obama was interested in pursuing digital media ventures after he left office.

Jen Psaki, the White House communications director at the time, told CNN that ""he is very interested in how people consume information and the changing trends,"" citing online and mobile news consumption.",real

Baio, 57, confirmed the news in a heartfelt retweet of his wife's post about her diagnosis.

This isn't the first health trouble for Baio's wife.

In 2015, the Happy Days actor revealed on Facebook that she had been diagnosed with a brain tumor.

More recently, the Baios have made headlines for the sexual misconduct charges former Charles in Charge co-star Nicole Eggert has lodged against the actor. Baio said he and Eggert had a consensual relationship when she was 18.

Tom Brady eats his 1st strawberry and chugs a beer with Stephen Colbert

Stephen Colbert got into a beer-drinking contest with Tom Brady on Monday -- and, perhaps more surprising, convinced the star quarterback to eat his first strawberry.

The two decided to throw back a cold one after Colbert asked the New England Patriots quarterback what he eats when he's ""falling off the wagon"" with his diet.

""Cheeseburgers, pizza, beer ... things like that,"" Brady said. ""I was a pretty good beer-chugger back in the day.""

Colbert promptly pulled out two tall glasses of brew.

""You were a good beer chugger?"" Colbert asked. ""Do you want to chug a beer?""

""Let's try ... can we spill?” Brady asked, before chugging the drink in less than three seconds. Colbert took a little longer to finish.

""That was good,"" Brady said with a big smile. ""That was really good!""

The five-time Super Bowl champion stopped by to promote his new book, ""The TB12 Method,"" in which he discusses nutrition and explains how to achieve a lifetime of sustained peak performance, according to his website.

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady walks off the field after the Patriots lost Super Bowl 52 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Feb. 4, 2018, in Minneapolis.

The quarterback said his diet consists of lots of fruits and vegetables, but he’d never eaten a strawberry.

""Oh, man, I hate strawberries,"" Brady, 40, said. ""I just hate the smell.""

Colbert, in utter disbelief, went on to present him with a bowl full of bright red strawberries and another challenge.

Brady, a true competitor at heart, eventually accepted the challenge to taste one, although it took some convincing.

""Not that bad,"" Brady said as he placed the half-eaten fruit back into the bowl. ""I did it. Mom, are you proud of me?""",real

But right up there with the rest of ‘em is the ongoing saga involving . . . Prince George’s obsession with the police.

You’ll remember that back in December, Prince William handed a handwritten list to a Finnish Santa Claus on behalf of his 4-year-old son, in which George listed just one item he wanted for Christmas: a police car. And then on Tuesday, William and Harry attended a reception at Kensington Palace honoring those who work in Scotland Yard, and William confirmed that—rest assured—months later, George is still just as infatuated.

Police commissioner Jayne Richardson told William that there are more officers needed in the district, joking, “We are recruiting, actually, so if George and Charlotte are keen?”

William responded, “[George] is obsessed, actually, by the police . . . cars, toys, everything.”

Where is this George and the police story line going to take us? Will we ever get to see a Halloween portrait of George dressed as a small policeman? Will Markle, in an effort to ingratiate herself to her soon-to-be nephew, let him wear some sort of police badge for his duties in her wedding? What does Princess Charlotte make of all of this?

While cameras weren’t allowed inside the Oscars party, an unnamed insider who was in the room told The Jasmine Brand that Aiko would have disapproved of the two talking. “[Sean and Scherzinger] both attended an Oscar Awards after-party together and were cozied up together sitting at a table in VIP,” the source claimed. “They were all over each other and they looked really comfortable around each other. They looked like they were a couple.”

When Aiko allegedly heard of their flirtation, she was livid. The source continued, “She was pissed, she confronted him about it, and he didn’t really deny it.”

The Shade Room initially captured proof that Aiko unfollowed Sean and published it in a since-deleted Instagram post. But now, the singer has gone back to following Sean. The two started dating in 2016; toward the end of 2017, Aiko even got a portrait tattoo of Sean on the back of her arm.",real

-920528,All of these faces are fake celebrities spawned by AI,"One of the more unexpected outcomes of the contemporary AI boom is just how good these systems are at generating fake imagery. The latest example comes from chipmaker Nvidia, which published a paper showing how AI can create photorealistic pictures of fake celebrities. Generating fake celebs isn’t in itself new, but researchers say these are the most convincing and detailed pictures of their type ever made.

The video below shows the process in full, starting with the database of celebrity images the system was trained on. The researchers used what’s known as a generative adversarial network, or GAN, to make the pictures. GANs are actually comprised of two separate networks: one that generates the imagery based on the data it’s fed, and a second discriminator network (the adversary) that checks if they’re real.

By working together, these two networks can produce some startlingly good fakes. And not just faces either — everyday objects and landscapes can also be created. The generator networks produces the images, the discriminator checks them, and then the generator improves its output accordingly. Essentially, the system is teaching itself.

There are limitations to this method of course. The pictures created are extremely small by the standards of modern cameras (just 1,024 by 1,024 pixels) and there are quite a few tell-tale signs they’re fake. For a start, they look like the celebrities the system was trained on (check out the Beyoncé lookalike early on) and there are glitchy parts in most images, like an ear that dribbles away into red mush.

As we’ve discussed in the past, this sort of technology could be put to all sorts of uses. There are obvious benefits for the creative industries, for making things like advertising and video games. But there’s also a threat in the form of disinformation. Sure, talented image editors have been able to create fake celeb photos for years using Photoshop, but AI tools will make this work quick and easy. (Adobe is already working on a number of AI-powered projects.)",real

The first Monday in May usually hosts the party of the year in the fashion world: the Met Gala. This year, though, the party was shut down before it started.

On March 16, the Met Gala was indefinitely postponed. A new date has not yet been announced. The last time the Met Gala was postponed was in 2002, and that was because of the 9/11 attacks the prior year, The Hollywood Reporter's Lindsay Weinberg reported.

-921551,The first look of Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in 'Judy' will send you over the rainbow,"Renée Zellweger has transformed herself into the legendary Judy Garland.

The producers of the biopic Judy released the first image of Zellweger as Garland to announce the start of production Monday on Twitter.

The result is a stunning likeness.

Judy is set in winter 1968 as Garland arrives in London for a run of sell-out concerts at the Talk of the Town nightclub.

More:Judy Garland's remains moved from NY to LA

Garland died of an accidental overdose in 1969 at age 47 in London. But in the film, she is doing her best to carry on.

""It is 30 years since she shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz, but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only grown,"" a release from the filmmakers states.

The movie will recount Garland's performances, with Zellweger singing some of her best-known numbers — including Somewhere Over the Rainbow from her greatest film success in 1939's The Wizard of Oz.

Judy will also delve into Garland’s behind-the-scenes battles with her management, her relationships with charmed musicians and fans as well as family drama playing out behind-the-scenes of the London performances.

""Judy is fragile,"" the film release states. ""After working for 45 of her 47 years, she is exhausted; haunted by memories of a childhood lost to Hollywood; gripped by a desire to be back home with her kids. Will she have the strength to go on?""

The cast includes Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock and Harry Potter's Michael Gambon. British stage director Rupert Goold is directing.

No release date has been given.

-921770,'I Miss You So Much': Cheryl Burke Breaks Social Media Hiatus to Mourn Death of Her Father,"Sending hugs to Cheryl Burke.

The new Dance Moms star, 33, shed light on why she was stepping away from social media on Monday when she shared that her father, Stephen Louis Burke, died earlier this month. Burke shared a throwback photo of herself as a child getting a kiss on her head from her dad.

“Dad, if I had one more chance to have you here with me today, I would do things differently,” she captioned the sweet shot on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. “Every day I would tell you how much I love you. I miss you so much already.”

The Dancing with the Stars pro added that her father passed away on March 9, nearly a month shy of his 68th birthday.

Burke told PEOPLE in 2011 that she felt “abandoned” after her parents split when she was a toddler. Her mother remarried in 1993 — and Burke forged a close bond with her stepfather Bob Wolf, whom she calls Dad.

During a 2012 appearance on Bethenny Frankel‘s talk show, the dancer said she had been estranged from her dad for a decade but reconnected after he was in a bad accident.

“I just wanted to make sure that everything in my life was okay, and I felt like there was that void in my life,” Burke explained. “I have a wonderful stepfather who has been my father, but it was really important for me just to reach out to my dad. Just for me and to like, have some closure if anything really were to happen.”

The sad announcement comes just six days after Burke told fans she would be taking a hiatus from social media because she was “dealing with some personal things right now” on March 13, only a few days after her father’s passing.

“Thanks for your understanding,” she continued, “and remember to tell the people who are important to you just how much you love them each and everyday. Xoxo Cheryl.”",real

The former Desperate Housewives star purchased the house for $3.6 million back in August 2006. The lavish contemporary Mediterranean-style home features nine bathrooms and six bedrooms, with a fireplace in each. Common areas in the house are primarily found on the second floor (there are three floors total, connected by a circular staircase with wrought-iron railings), and include a combination living-dining room with two fireplaces and several wood-trimmed glass doors leading out onto a wraparound balcony and a kitchen with an oversize center island and a cozy breakfast nook.

Along with a fireplace, the master suite has a sitting area, not one but two custom-fitted walk-in closets, and a tumbled travertine tiled bathroom with an additional gas fireplace between a large tub and a separate, glass-enclosed steam shower. The home also includes a subterranean ground-floor level with a state-of-the-art screening room, as well as a cavelike family room with a large wet bar and large windows that peek directly into the depth of the swimming pool. Outside, Longoria’s home is no less luxe, with a stone-tiled, courtyard-sized yard; a sheltered dining terrace complete with an outdoor kitchen and barbecue area; and a swimming pool and spa with grand mountainous views.

-921765,Britney Spears Is The New Face Of Kenzo,"Parisian-based fashion house, KENZO, has named Britney Spears as its newest spokesperson, with a campaign called Kenzo Presents Britney Spears, with its own hashtag, #kenzolovesbritney. After several teaser shots of the new campaign—officially called “La Collection Memento N°2“—KENZO and Spears finally unveiled their partnership on their social media channels.

The campaign, shot by legendary photographer Peter Lindbergh, focuses on the idea of cultural icons—something that Spears wholeheartedly embodies. With a heavy focus on denim and the quintessential KENZO motifs, the collection is vast and wide ranging for both men, women and some pieces that may be worn by both genders. One of those motifs, for which KENZO had become internationally recognized, is “the jumping tiger,” developed by Kenzo Takada in the 1970s.

“I was really flattered when KENZO approached me to the face of their 50th anniversary line,” began Spears. “I love the brand, and with denim being a big part of this collection, it made it that much more appealing to me since denim is such a part of my own style.” (Who could ever forget her matching denim-on-denim moment on the Grammy’s red carpet with then-beau Justin Timberlake?)

The collection elevates the ever-popular “athleisure” trend. For the main ad campaign shot, Britney Spears wears the Cropped ‘Bamboo Tiger’ Sweatshirt, the Denim ‘Bamboo Tiger’ Denim Baseball Cap (already sold out), The Mini Denim ‘Kanagawa Wave’ Rucksack and the Denim Shorts.

The collaboration certainly is a match made in heaven. Spears’ is a timeless, American icon, and her reign as the queen of pop will surely last generations to come.

Chronicling his early morning visit, Kimmel and Couric ventured to the hospital at 5:30 a.m. where Couric praised the late-night host for being a “big boy” and assured him that once he completes the procedure he won’t have to do it again for another five to 10 years, which Kimmel then jokingly compared to the Olympics.

While waiting for the procedure to begin, Kimmel shared a few quips with Couric about the awkwardness of her being present for his first procedure. “I’m telling you, I met some real perverts in my life, but you take the cake, Katie Couric,” Kimmel told the anchor.

Couric, whose husband died of colon cancer, emphasized that despite the common dread most people feel over getting the procedure done, “it’s a lot more fun than being diagnosed with colorectal cancer.” “You should put that on a bumper sticker. A long bumper sticker,” Kimmel said.

Prior to Kimmel’s procedure, Couric poked fun at the late-night host as she challenged the nurses to thoroughly clean his colon enough to find the iTunes gift card she hid inside. “Whoever finds it, it’s yours,” Couric joked.

Later, Kimmel learned that his colonoscopy procedure went smoothly, until Couric admitted that they found some unusual personal items of his along the way such as his car keys, action figures and a harmonica.

-921946,"Queen Elizabeth called Camilla 'that wicked woman' after 'several martinis,' new book claims","After Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles went public with their romance in the early 2000s, Queen Elizabeth II was not quick to bless the couple with her royal approval, having once reportedly called Bowles ""that wicked woman,"" according to British investigative journalist Tom Bower.

In Bower's new biography, ""Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and Defiance of Prince Charles,"" the journalist dives deep into the life of the second in line to the throne and his scandalous relationship with Bowles, whom he married after the death of Princess Diana.

According to the book, following Diana's death, Prince Charles presented the idea of welcoming Bowles into the royal family, but the Queen was not on the same page.

The Daily Mail shared an excerpt from the book in which Bower claimed the Queen called Camilla ""that wicked woman” and said she wanted ""nothing to do with her"" after having ""several martinis.""

The excerpt continued on to say that the Queen was unhappy about Charles' relationship with Camilla during his marriage to Diana.

""[She] would not condone his adultery, nor forgive Camilla for not leaving Charles alone to allow his marriage to recover.""

Charles then allegedly called Bowles and delivered a ""tearful"" message.

The Queen remained skeptical about the relationship for several years following Diana's 1997 passing, the book claims.

It wasn't until 2005 that the Queen gave her permission to her son to marry Bowles, though Bowles had already moved into Clarence House back in 2003. The couple was not given permission to marry at the Church of England so they wed at Windsor Town Hall and were later blessed in St. George's Chapel, where Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle will tie the knot on May 19.

Though the Queen eventually approved her son's marriage to Bowles, according to Bower she was still not keen on a big celebratory ceremony for their union.

In his book, the journalist claims that Queen nixed any plans for a big wedding reception, ending talks about a big 650-person affair.

Distraught by the smaller scale wedding plans, Charles reportedly ""wallowed in gloom.""

Since the 2005 nuptials, Bowles has reportedly slowly grown on the Queen and can now be seen standing alongside the royal family at public events and during family outings.",real

Tom Jones, Kylie Minogue, Sting and Shaggy, Shawn Mendes, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Anne-Marie, Craig David and Donel Mangena as set to perform.

The world's longest-reigning living monarch will attend the concert, known as ""The Queen's Birthday Party,"" along with other members of the royal family.

The concert will benefit The Queen's Commonwealth Trust, youth charity for which the queen is patron.

Buckingham Palace also announced Saturday that Prince Harry will serve as president of the trust. He is expected to speak at the concert for the first time in his new role, which will include leading tributes to his grandmother.

Earlier in the day, honorary gun salutes were staged in Hyde Park, the Tower of London and the town of Windsor to mark the occasion.

The queen celebrates two birthdays every year: Her actual birthday on Apr. 21, which she usually marks privately with her family, and her ""official birthday"" in the summer. That usually falls on the second Saturday in June, when she joins the Trooping the Color military parade in central London.

Elizabeth's official birthday this year came on the tails of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, which brought the leaders of the 53 Commonwealth countries together in England.

The queen has led the disparate group, made up of Britain and its former colonies, since she took the throne in 1952.

The lanky comic took Tan's frank fashion advice in good-humored stride -- they literally strut, hand in hand, into Saks Fifth Avenue.

""Don't feel bad -- someone has to tell me! ... I trust you a lot more than my Staten Island fashion knowledge,"" Davidson says. ""... It's so funny, I thought I was like, kind of dressing well, but it's so nice to know that I've been dressing like [bleep] the entire time.""

In the new video posted ""SNL's"" YouTube page (check it out above), Tan pokes fun Pete's Staten Island roots and frozen-in-puberty vibe before pulling a few chic looks from the Saks racks for him to model.

So why the attempted upgrade? The 24-year-old admits he wants to dress to impress his mate Cazzie David's ""cool family."" (Yes, her dad is Larry David of ""Seinfeld"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" fame.)

Three charming Pete-to-Tan revelations: He ""never, NEVER"" thinks he's sexy, he doesn't ""even have mirrors at my house 'cause I don't like my face"" and his fashion sense is a case of arrested development: ""I think like an 18-year-old kids, like -- 'those are cool!'"" when picking out clothes.

Justin Timberlake and Demi Lovato both announced on Twitter their Wednesday night shows have been postponed.

Lovato was the first to tweet about the cancellation at the Prudential Center in Newark. It is unclear how many people bought tickets for the show, but the venue can hold up to 19,500 people, NJ.com reports.

“Sad to announce that we need to reschedule the show tonight in Newark due to the extreme weather conditions,” Lovato tweeted.

The show, part of the singer’s “Tell Me You Love Me” tour with DJ Khaled, has been rescheduled for April 2.

Timberlake later tweeted that his Madison Square Garden show Wednesday night has been postponed to an unknown date. He still expects to perform at his Thursday show.

“Hey y’all, so sorry so announce the show tonight at the Garden has been postponed due to the weather, as you can see,” Timberlake said in a video tweet, showing snow piling up on the ground around him. “Man, I’m bummed.”

The singer ended with a rhetorical question, noting it’s not even winter anymore: “Happy spring, everybody?”

The Garden holds about 20,000 people. It is not clear how many were purchased for Wednesday’s show.

Timberlake’s tour kicked off this month and supports his new album, “Man of the Woods,” released days before he headlined this year’s Super Bowl halftime show.

Wednesday’s storm could dump more than a foot of snow across the region. Multiple crashes have been reported, including a fatal wreck on Long Island, and commuters have faced delays on public transit.",real

Chrissy Metz has gained worldwide fame since starring in the hit NBC drama This Is Us. Appearing alongside actors Mandy Moore, Sterling K. Brown, and Justin Hartley, Metz plays Kate Pearson, a 30-something struggling with her body image. Since the series' debut in 2016, the character has been a fan-favorite that many viewers have found incredibly relatable. ""You don't realize that somebody who's average or even very fit could relate to someone who's overweight,"" Metz told People in February 2017, ""but it's not about our size — it's how we look at ourselves and how we feel about ourselves.""

Despite Metz's on-screen success, we'd wager that most TV fans don't know about the details of the actress' tragic real-life story. From family troubles and heartbreaking issues related to her weight to a failed marriage and financial strain, Metz has gone through a lot over the years. She's overcome a childhood littered with insecurities to emerge into the self-assured woman she is today, but it hasn't been easy for the former American Horror Story star.

'Stranger Things' cast rallies behind fan after no one showed to his birthday party

New York -- After being stood up by friends at his ""Stranger Things""-themed birthday party, one fan of the Netflix show is poised to have the best party yet next year.

Ayen Alambat tweeted pictures from her little brother Aaron's birthday party over the weekend with a sad message attached to some very festive pictures.

""My brother invited 8 of his classmates for his stranger things themed bday party & none of their punk selves showed up,"" the caption read next to a picture of Aaron’s toughing out his birthday alone like a champ, eating a special cake and doing a classic pose from the show.

The tweet immediately went viral and now boasts well over 200,000 “likes.”

But it also caught the attention of the show's young stars, including Millie Bobby Brown and Gaten Matarazzo.

""What!!!! Oh Well You can let them all know that everyone on behalf on Stranger things would’ve come! I think your [sic] awesome and next year I would like an invite... Please?"" Brown, 14, tweeted back at Alambat.

Matarazzo, 15, jumped in in, too, offering to bring a snack for next year's big shindig.

""Count me in too! I’ll bring the chocolate pudding,"" he added.

Alambat basically lost her mind after seeing the tweets.

It's time to say goodbye to a dear friend. We may not have known him for long, but he certainly made an impact on us while he was here. Farewell, King Stache.

Earlier today, Henry Cavill shaved off his beloved mustache, the source of so much controversy late last year. As a tribute, the Justice League and Mission Impossible star posted a video on his Facebook page to honor his former facial hair.

The video features Cavill in a bath robe telling fans that King Stache is indeed gone. He shared it to his page with the simple message ""#ShavedButNotForgotten.""

You can watch the full video above!

""I know, it's hard to recognize me without King Stache,"" Cavill said to the camera, before turning his attention to himself in the mirror. ""Sometimes, I have a hard time recognizing myself.""

It was only a matter of time before Cavill threw some shade onto the infamous mustache incident. As you surely recall, the actor had the mustache while filming Mission: Impossible - Fallout and was brought back to the set of Justice League for extensive reshoots. Since he wasn't allowed to shave the facial hair due to his obligations to Mission: Impossible, the mustache had to be removed from Justice League via CGI. We all know how that went.

Staring right into the soul of the camera, Cavill said, ""It's hard for me to admit, this it NOT CGI.""

The video concludes with Sarah McLachlan's ""I Will Remember You"" playing over a montage of photos featuring King Stache. Of course, one of these images is the Cavill's CGI'd face, showing how terrible it looked without the mustache.

Fans have mourned the loss of the beautiful stache all morning. Popular fan artist BossLogic even paid tribute to King Stache by creating a poster, bidding goodbye to the facial hair.

So long, King Stache. You may be gone, but you'll never be forgotten.",real

Avruch died Tuesday at his Boston home from heart disease, his family said in a statement to WCVB-TV .

Avruch played Bozo the Clown from 1959 to 1970, a clown character particularly popular in the U.S. in the 1960s because of widespread franchising in television. Avruch became the first nationally-syndicated Bozo the Clown.

""He had a heart of gold,"" manager Stuart Hersh told The Associated Press on Wednesday, ""He brought the Bozo the Clown character to life better than anyone else's portrayal of Bozo the Clown.""

Avruch also was a contributor to WCVB-TV for more than 40 years as a host of Man About Town and The Great Entertainment.

Avruch passed away on Tuesday, March 20, 2018, of heart disease at his Boston home.

He was an active philanthropist and a board member of UNICEF'S New England chapter. He toured the world performing as Bozo the clown for UNICEF.

""He touched so many people with his portrayal,"" Hersh said.

Avruch is survived by his wife Betty, two sons Matthew and Steven and several grandchildren.

""While it's hard to say goodbye, we celebrate the legacy of joy and laughter he brought to millions of children around the world as Bozo the Clown on TV and as a UNICEF Ambassador and later as host of Channel 5's Great Entertainment and Boston's Man About Town,"" Avruch's family said in a statement to the station.

But now 48-year-old Pompeo is quashing rumors that her landmark paycheck caused two of her former co-stars, Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew, to exit the series.

""It's absolutely not true,"" Pompeo said of the chatter during her Thursday appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show.""

Both actresses left the long-running ABC medical drama earlier this month, with rumors swirling that Pompeo's salary made ""Grey's"" unable to keep them on.

While Pompeo wasn't certain why Capshaw and Drew are no longer cast members, she guessed it was a creative decision on the show's part.

""I mean, I’m not involved in these kind of decisions; however, there’s a few problems that you encounter doing a show for 14 seasons,"" she explained. ""One of them is the writers have a really hard time creatively thinking up new stories for all these characters. I think we have 16 regular cast members, and I think it’s always sad when we lose people for whatever reason.""

""Whether they want to go or don’t want to go, it doesn’t make it any easier,"" she added.

In an CBS Sunday Morning interview with Tracy Smith set to air this weekend, Penn says he really doesn’t dig the whole acting thing anymore. “You know, I think that this has been true for some time,” he tells Smith. “It can be great when you’re working with good actors or good directors or good writing as an exercise, but do I have a belief that it has a lasting value? Maybe, I could make the argument intellectually. But I don’t have a visceral – I’m not in love with that anymore.”

Maybe all he needs are some tasty waves and a cool buzz and he’ll be fine.

But there are other aspects of the industry that still do it for him, like writing — which he does in longhand. The interview is tied to the release of his first novel, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff, which is due Tuesday from Simon & Schuster. It’s about a septic tank salesman-turned-assassin who kills people with a mallet. Among his other actions, Honey sends a letter containing a veiled threat to a fictional president.

Does he worry people won’t get the joke?

“You know, some people are going to get this book and some people are – not going to get this book,” Penn says in the interview. “Some people, I think, will really enjoy it, others will loathe it. And – and that really is what I’d like to say about me, you know?”

For me, I’m just not quite sure where it fits, especially when it feels so easy to get married, and then the untangling — when the state gets involved.”

“There is the importance of how other people then treat you as a married man than as a man with a girlfriend,” she continued. “I do think it is important how other people respect a relationship … I’m not saying it’s a good reason, but it is a small benefit of having that label of being married.”

Her quotes come following her shocking split from husband Chris Pratt. In August 2017 the couple and parents to son Jack announced they were splitting after 8 years of marriage.

During her chat with Dax, she admitted that their #relationshipgoals beloved fan marriage didn’t help with the split.

“Chris and I did talk about [it]. We got, like, on the Twitter feed, ‘Love is dead’ and ‘relationship goals,'” she recalled of reading people’s reaction. “I think what we were also guilty of — we obviously cultivated something and it was rewarding for a while. It was like ‘People seem to think we got all this s--t right.’ ”",real

She also gave an update on her husband, who checked into rehab earlier this month, according to Us Weekly.

When an Instagram user asked if Ryan was still in rehab, Mackenzie said, “He is doing SO good. Proud of him!”

Mackenzie gave birth to the couple’s first child — son Jagger Ryan Edwards — on Oct. 9, PEOPLE confirms. He weighed 7 lbs. and 1 oz., according to Radar Online.

Jagger is Mackenzie’s second child. She also has son Hudson, 4, from a previous relationship.

PEOPLE is out to MTV for comment.

The reality TV pair secretly tied the knot before Ryan, who shares Bentley with Teen Mom OG‘s Maci Bookout, headed to rehab back in May 2017, and they exchanged vows at a church ceremony in November 2017.

In an April episode of Teen Mom OG, Mackenzie confirmed her pregnancy when she showed a positive test to producer Jeni, who quickly hugged and congratulated her.

When asked if her husband was happy, Mackenzie said, “[He] was so excited, he couldn’t contain himself.”

Throughout her pregnancy, Mackenzie shared shots of her growing baby bump to Instagram.

Her soon-to-be husband, Prince Harry, has been looking seriously buff recently, and according to sources, the 33-year-old has undergone an “intense pre wedding fitness routine” ahead of his big day.



According to E! News Harry has quit cigarettes, although an insider is keen to state that he was never a “full time” smoker.



“He smoked socially, but as he doesn’t go out as much anymore, he naturally lost interest in smoking,” spilled a source.



The former soldier is also said to have upped his fitness regime.



“He was already in good shape when he met Meghan but the two of them enjoy healthy living together. They eat sensibly, his diet is very clean and ahead of the wedding, he is working out five times a week with a personal trainer,” a source shared.

-923279,Danny Amendola reportedly couldn't handle Olivia Culpo's lifestyle,"Olivia Culpo was a New England Patriots fan long before she met and fell in love with Danny Amendola, so perhaps the death knell sounded on their relationship when he joined the rival Miami Dolphins. Everyone of a certain age who grew up in New England had a dad or an uncle with a fading “Squish the Fish” t-shirt from 1986 — and it can be difficult to shake those cultural ties.

Of course, the more likely scenario is that the two grown adults found their relationship untenable for a variety of reasons that had less to do with the uniform he now wears and more to do with the fact that they’re now based in two different cities.

A source told Us Weekly that “[the breakup] had to do with the distance and them barely seeing each other” because Culpo had no intention of moving to Miami, adding that he wasn’t thrilled with her nude photo shoot in Sports Illustrated.

Another source who spoke with E! News compounded the drama, claiming that Amendola was unhappy with Olivia’s life choices.

Via Eonline.com:

“Danny couldn’t handle Olivia’s demanding lifestyle and wasn’t pleased with certain choices she was making,” says the source. “The constant travel was also causing a rift.”

Culpo, a Rhode Island native who rose to fame after being crowned Miss USA and then Miss Universe in 2012, lives in the Northeast and has a very busy career as a model. Amendola is an NFL wide receiver. The fact that the two made it as long as they did was a miracle, honestly.

""For the record: i wasn't too busy to work on deadpool,"" Glover tweeted before sharing the script, which takes a few shots at Marvel, and hilariously pokes fun at the who bit Beyonce mystery (and implies Sanaa Lathan is the culprit).

During his time alone with Sudan, Deapool wonders why his animated series was canceled, asking, ""What? The Marvel stuff I said in it? All I said was Marvel was trying to sell toys to seven-year-old boys and 50-year-old pedophiles.""

Deadpool continues, confessing that it might not be a good time to have a ""violent, gun loving white man ranting on TV."" ""Do you think they canceled the show...cause of racism?!"" he asks. ""All the writers were black. And the references were pretty black, too. I heard they went over the lunch budget ordering Jamaican food at least once a week.""

""It just feels like everyone wants something different, but no one wants to do anything different to get it.

After “This Is Us” tormented fans with difficult IVF treatments and a devastating miscarriage, it seems Kate is finally having Toby’s baby. And though pregnancies are strictly joyous life events for some small-screen families, nothing is that easy for the Pearson family. Chrissy Metz, who plays Kate, says she and Chris Sullivan (Toby) are about to show America something they have never seen before with this baby — at least on network TV.

“Toby and Kate are going to have a bit of an unconventional parenting situation,” Metz told Entertainment Weekly in a recent interview. “Not unconventional in that people aren’t doing it, but not what I think either of them ever had in mind.”

Toby is struggling with depression, and Metz says this twist to Kate’s pregnancy storyline is going to be a tough one — not just for Kate on-screen, but for her personally.

“It’s going to be challenging for me as an actress, which I’m excited about — scared but excited,” Metz said. “It’s something I don’t think we’ve ever seen, at least not on network television.”

“This Is Us” showrunner Elizabeth Berger says Kate and Toby will have “very specific struggles” and “it’s not necessarily something that we’ve seen up close before.”

“But nothing about Kate and Toby’s journey thus far has been pretty conventional, and it’s going to continue to be something that they have to navigate very carefully,” Berger says. “We’re excited to share their journey. It’s a really specific one that we’ve been plotting out very carefully.”

In an upcoming BBC documentary, R. Kelly’s ex-girlfriend accuses the R&B singer and alleged sexual predator of “training” a 14-year-old girl to be a sex slave, the Guardian reports.

This is the latest of many accusations against R. Kelly, whose alleged sex crimes first came under major public scrutiny months before the current #MeToo movement. The second half of 2017 saw a number of explosive investigations into his alleged abuse — one about a “cult” he runs that preys on young women, one about the singer’s inner circle, and another about the alleged physical and emotional abuse that former girlfriend Kitti Jones suffered while she was with the R&B singer. During this time, there was an additional woman who accused R. Kelly of grooming her to be a sex slave when she was 16.

Jones is the woman behind the most recent allegation. The Guardian reports that in the documentary, Jones says that the R&B singer introduced her to an unnamed young “sex slave” sometime between 2011 and 2013.

“I was introduced to one of the girls, that he told me he ‘trained’ since she was 14, those were his words,” she said. “I saw that she was dressed like me, that she was saying the things I’d say and her mannerisms were like mine. That’s when it clicked in my head that he had been grooming me to become one of his pets. He calls them his pets.”

Jones also said that Kelly forced the young girl, whom he referred to as his “fucking pet,” to crawl around the floor and perform oral sex on him.

While Kelly did not comment to either the BBC or the Guardian, the R&B singer has vehemently denied all allegations against him in the past. The BBC Three documentary is scheduled to air tomorrow, March 28.",real

It featured on listings for ""Women's and Men's Suede Leather Fur Boots"" and ""Women's Fringed Suede Moccasin Boots,"" for example — boots both being sold at a 46% discount but, you know, still with 100% racism.

""[Kojwa and Margines] are separate companies,"" a Groupon spokesperson explained, adding that they are ""Chinese-based enterprises."" ""This is a known issue in the e-commerce space,"" they continued. ""We're determining why the deal slipped past the controls we have in place (we flag literally hundreds of terms and various permutations) and will make the necessary improvements.""

Customers have said that they will no longer give any more of their money to Groupon due to this incident. ""I will no longer purchase anything from Groupon due to boots you advertise for sale,"" one wrote on Twitter. ""Poor taste and highly offensive, but I’m glad you felt comfortable selling them....now I know how you really feel.""

In a statement Bill Roberts, the vice president of Global Communications for the company, told Cosmopolitan.com that the language used is ""completely unacceptable and violates our policies."" Roberts added that the language used was from a third party seller. Here is Roberts' full statement:

""We are appalled that this language was displayed on our site. This product description was provided by a third-party seller via our self-service platform. Regardless, this is completely unacceptable and violates our policies -- to say nothing of our values.

-923973,Cameron Diaz says she’s ‘actually retired’,"Story highlights Actress sits down to chat with her ""Sweetest Thing"" co-stars Industry has speculated about star's status for months

CNN —

Being out of the limelight may be “The Sweetest Thing” for Cameron Diaz right now.

The actress recently reunited with her co-stars from that 2002 comedy, Selma Blair and Christina Applegate, for an interview with Entertainment Weekly to reminisce about the film.

The topic of the trio having not reunited was brought up.

Applegate noted that she sees Blair (their children are friends), and Blair in turn asked Diaz about a possible reunion.

“Maybe I should, you know, I mean, I’m down,” Diaz said. “I’m literally doing nothing.”

Applegate said she is “semi-retired” and hasn’t worked for years as she’s been focused on being a mom.

“That’s so awesome. I’m totally down,” Diaz said. “I’m semi-retired, too, and I am actually retired, so I would love to see you ladies.”

Diaz last appeared in the 2014 remake of “Annie,” and her status in the industry was buzzed about in early March after Blair’s interview with Metro News UK.

In it the “Cruel Intentions” star talked about having a recent lunch with Diaz.

“We were reminiscing about the film,” Blair said. “I would have liked to do a sequel but Cameron’s retired from acting. She’s like ‘I’m done.’ “

Blair later sought to clarify her comments on Twitter after they went viral.

“Guys please, I was making a joke in an interview. CAMERON DIAZ is NOT retiring from ANYTHING,” Blair tweeted. “And for more breaking news: I am NOW retiring from being Cameron Diaz’s spokesperson.”

Diaz married rocker Benji Madden in 2015.",real

The 22-year-old artist is taking the music industry by storm and is not okay with the underlying sexism within the industry. In an interview with British GQ, she says, “For a female artist, it takes a lot more to be taken seriously if you’re not sat down at a piano or with a guitar, you know.” She also added her perspective on the music industry for males. She says, “For a male artist, people instantly assume they write their own music, but for women, they assume it’s all manufactured.”

Dua Lipa understands the stuff she is saying considering she does not play any instruments while she sings, but she does write all of her own songs. She is credited to all but two songs on her album as her own words.

Putting aside her frustrations with the music industry, Dua Lipa is in the process of writing music for her new album and according to her, it is all about “dance crying.” She says, “It is a pop album that you’re going to be able to dance to, but a lot of the songs are sad.”

In a new video posted Thursday, the cast of Shonda Rhimes’ presidential drama looks back over the past seven seasons on the hit show, shares gratitude for the series’ diehard fans, and does a lot of behind-the-scenes dancing.

“There isn’t a single feeling I haven’t had about the show ending,” says Kerry Washington, who plays the drama’s lead Olivia Pope. Knowing this season would be the last, the cast has had the chance to make the most of the 18 episodes they had left to shoot to say goodbye to each other and their characters. “After seven years of being together, we are very, very, very, very tight,” adds Katie Lowes (Quinn Perkins) as the video flashes back to on-set moments celebrating landmarks and behind-the-scenes footage from the final episodes.

As for the last day of shooting? “I think for our last day on set there will be lots of waterproof mascara,” says Bellamy Young (Mellie Grant). Those tears might not be reserved for off-camera moments, as ultimately someone will be walking away brokenhearted. According to Scott Foley, Jake “would like to be back on the island with Olivia,” but not if Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) has anything to say about it.

“No, absolutely not,” Goldwyn declares. “I think Olivia’s one true love is Fitz.”

But in the end, it’s likely there’ll only be one truly happy person in the Scandal universe. “The only human that’s guaranteed a happy ending is Shonda Rhimes,” says Pope. They don’t call it Shondaland for nothing, after all.

The Teen Mom OG star was granted the order of protection against Edwards on Monday, according to E! News.

Edwards’ attorney Jonathan Turner told the outlet Edwards was not allowed to be within 100 feet of Bookout, her husband Taylor McKinney and their two children, Jayde 2, Maverick, 24 months. Bookout shares oldest son, Bentley, 9, with Edwards.

The order of protection will not affect his ability to see their son Bentley, Turner said as it will give him “a lot more protection against any false allegations, allows him to avoid getting arrested without a hearing first, and allows him to be around his son most importantly.”

Representatives for Edwards and Bookout did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

The mother of three initially filed for an order of protection in March and listed her three children, Jayde, Maverick and Bentley in the protection order. McKinney also filed an order of protection against Edwards.

She shares Bentley with Edwards, while her youngest two she shares with husband Taylor McKinney.

Considering this and in celebration of this Burton classic’s 30th anniversary, The Hollywood Reporter takes a look at what the Beetlejuice cast has been up to in the years since, to see how they’ve “jump(ed) in the line” in other projects.

Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse

But in a special PSA for E! News, Kraines warns that being the butt of a joke has haunted him for years.

“Hi. I’m Todd Kraines and you literally would know me from one thing and one thing only,” he says. “In honor of April Fools’ Day, I’m here to bring awareness to the consequences seemingly harmless pranks can have on people’s lives — not just for a day, but forever. So f—– up man.”

He adds in the E! clip, “The Todd Kraines prank placed me in an extremely, extremely uncomfortable situation. Kris would call me asking if I was behind these pranks and I had no idea what the hell was going on. Do I need to call the FBI? Was someone using my name? Identity theft is a serious crime.”

Kraines has a stern warning for anyone ready to pull a fast one of their pals.

“This April Fools’ day, believe nothing and trust no one more than any other day,” he says. “Think before you prank and the aftermath could be eternally viral.”

For just a bit of revenge, Kraines calls up Kourtney in the E! clip to get the scoop on the long-running game.

“When that whole thing was going on, like did you guys ever think about how it would affect my life?” he asks, to which the reality stars admits, “No.”

But Mandy Moore is not most people. While on break from filming This Is Us, she decided to go and climb Mount Kilimanjaro. No big deal.

Moore made the trip alongside her fiancé, Taylor Goldsmith, and a group of friends. She started her adventure on March 23, and posted a photo of her climbing crew on Instagram. “I’ve been dreaming of seeing [the mountain] and doing this since I was 18,” she wrote.

And after the trip ended and she got service back, she posted photos from the climb. “I lived out one of the most rewarding and challenging experiences of my life with a few of my best friends,” she wrote.

Moore explained that getting to the summit of the mountain was incredibly grueling, dealing with awful weather, freezing temperatures, and total darkness. “Reaching the threshold of the true summit was more emotional and overwhelming than I had thought possible,” she wrote. “There’s nothing more empowering than realizing that we are all capable of so much more than we give ourselves credit for.”

Read her full caption below:

“On the night of our ascent to the summit, we woke up at 11pm (after a few hours of napping) to enjoy a couple of nervous minutes together with a cup of coffee before it was time to gear up in my our warmest layers and start the nearly 8 hour trek to highest point in Africa- 19,341 ft. In total darkness, we took it pole pole (slow slow) and trudged through rain, sleet and snow, where seemingly everything on our person managed to freeze (water bottles, backpacks, our eyelashes, hair, fingers, toes, etc...) Oddly, I’ve never felt more determined to tackle such a physical challenge before and yet the combined elements of exhaustion and extremely cold weather made it much trickier than any of us were prepared for.

All of that aside, ultimately reaching the threshold of the true summit was more emotional and overwhelming than I had thought possible. Kilimanjaro demands a lot from those who traverse her trails. You have no choice but to show up. And we did. There’s nothing more empowering than realizing that we are all capable of so much more than we give ourselves credit for.”",real

Blac Chyna is defending herself as a caring mother after she was caught on camera swinging a baby stroller in a public altercation at a Six Flags amusement park on Easter Sunday.

The 29-year-old mother of King Cairo and Dream Kardashian—her children with Tyga and Rob Kardashian, respectively—was seen allegedly getting into an argument at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, Calif. In videos shared on social media, Chyna is seen grabbing a pink stroller and swinging it around wildly. Neither child is seen in the footage, posted by Twitter user AliciaaAngiee.

The Tweets have since been deleted.

An eyewitness told E! News that the incident occurred at 6:45 p.m. at the exit of the X2 ride. It is not clear what incited the incident.

After the videos went viral, Chyna took to Instagram Stories to allude to a person setting her off by trying to touch her child. She did not reference the fight directly but the timing of the post appeared to coincide with the incident. She said she doesn't condone violence but she is a protective mother.

“Being famous is hard enough dealing with scrutiny but when someone feels comfortable to come and touch your child it’s a whole other story,” she said. “I do not condone violence nor am I a violent person but shout out to all of the amazing mothers out there that will protect their children at all cost.”

Chyna's new boyfriend, rapper YBN Almighty Jay, allegedly got involved in the altercation and tried to stop it, reports XXL. YBN and security reportedly attempted to restrain Chyna from the unidentified person.

The 51-year-old former Dance Moms star is still adjusting to life on the outside after spending eight and a half months in federal prison for bankruptcy fraud. She was sentenced in May to one year and a day in prison after pleading guilty to the charge. She was released early from her sentence at the Federal Correctional Complex in Victorville, California, last week and transferred to a halfway house in Long Beach, California, for the remainder of her sentence.

Splash News

Though she was released early, it wasn't as early as expected due to bureaucratic changes in the federal prison system.

""It was a pretty upsetting thing for her over the weekend to not be able to talk to anybody and find out what was happening,"" prison consultant and coach Jennifer Myers, who coached Miller before she went to jail, told ET in February. ""It didn’t make any sense. She had her halfway house plan and they just weren’t communicating with her that it wasn’t happening anymore.""

Still, Miller appears to be making the most of it, despite an apparently very strict atmosphere at the halfway house.

Miller reportedly lost 100 pounds in prison, for starters. And two days after her release, she was spotted out getting a pedicure at Pampered Hands in Los Angeles.",real
-924667,"Meghan Markle 'Wants to be Princess Diana 2.0', Says Book","As Meghan Markle prepares to officially enter life as a royal, a controversial new book by infamous royal biographer Andrew Morton, it set to be released.

The book, titled, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, to be released on April 17, delves further into her past and details her apparent “fascination” with fiancé Prince Harry’s late Mother, Princess Diana.

Morton, who famously penned the explosive 1992 biography on Diana, writes how Meghan “was intrigued by Diana not just for her style but also for her independent humanitarian mission”. Family friends say the Suits actress “saw her as a role model.”

“She was always fascinated by the royal family,” the star’s childhood friend Ninaki Priddy is quoted as saying in the book, according to an excerpt printed on The Times. “She wants to be Princess Diana 2.0.”

The 36-year-old, who studied a double major in theater and international relations at Northwestern University, followed her interest in politics by landing an internship at the US embassy in Buenos Aires.

“It was their economic devaluation and our Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Paul O’Neill, was there, so I’m 20 years old, in Buenos Aires, in a motorcade, doing that whole thing,” she previously told Marie Claire US. “I thought for sure I would still have a career in politics.”

While Meghan ended up in Hollywood rather than Washington, she did continue her interest in humanitarianism, working as a Global Ambassador for World Vision, working with the United Nations, she was a One Young World Counsellor and has long been an outspoken advocate for gender equality, all prior to meeting her future husband.

“What’s been really exciting, as we talk about this as the transition out of my career… is that the causes that have been very important to me, I can focus even more energy on,” Meghan said in her engagement interview with the BBC.

And so while comparisons are a waste of time and energy, if she was inspired by the incredible work Diana did, and can continue to fight for causes that need a voice and a platform like hers, then power to her we say!",real

But for Jenna Fischer, time ran out before she could fix the zipper of her dress and she was forced to sit through her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live wearing nothing but a bath towel.

The Office star walked out for her interview with Kimmel wearing a terrycloth white towel covering her bodice, with a pair of blue jeans, heels and diamond earrings.

“So this was my outfit tonight,” Fischer said gesturing to the maroon dress she brought on-stage with her. “And I waited too long to get dressed and then my zipper broke and I panicked.”

So like any quick-thinking star would do, she reached for the nearest towel and made it work. “I’m a Missouri girl and the show must go on,” she said.

Ditching her dress for a towel meant that Fischer has never been more comfortable and uncomfortable on air. “I’m mentally a little freaking out that I’m on a talk show in a towel but I’m psychically very comfortable.”

Crowds of both well-wishers and reporters are currently gathering outside the hospital, where Kate previously delivered both Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Princess Diana delivered both Prince William and Prince Harry in the hospital as well.

Regardless of whether this new child is a boy or a girl, it will be fifth in line to the throne, falling just after Princess Charlotte and just before Prince Harry.

The supermodel – and co-author (with her mother) of a new memoir, Perfect Is Boring – recently revealed she had a nose job early in her career. “I feel I have a responsibility to tell the truth,” she said.

When asked if she would have more work done, Banks told E! News: “You know, I would, if there was something to remove cellulite I would totally do it…It doesn’t exist though.”

The 44-year-old explained that she “always had cellulite” and it continues to be an “insecurity.”

“When I walked down the Victoria’s Secret runway, I always covered my butt. Always,” she said. “People used to think, ‘Oh, she’s one of the top angels. That’s why she has a long train or extra.’ No, I was covering up my cellulite. Thank you Victoria’s Secret for working with me, they knew why I was doing it.”

It’s okay to hop back and forth over that line. You want a hair weave? Fine. You want permanent eyebrows? Fine. We as women need to stop judging.”",real

Erik was then moved to the same unit as his brother Wednesday.

""He had been asking for it, and the department could find no reason they could not be at the same prison,"" Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections, told the New York Daily News. “There are people who are related who may also be crime partners, and it's not unprecedented for them to be living in the same prison or even sharing the same cell.""

The brothers, who are believed to have kept in contact only through letters, will now be able to spend time together at meals, during recreational periods and while exercising.

Tammi Menendez, who married Erik three years after his sentencing, told TheBlast.com that her husband is ""settling in"" and described the brothers' reunion as ""heartfelt.""

-925534,Cynthia Bailey Underwent Surgery to Remove a Lipoma Tumor: 'I Was Scared',"Cynthia Bailey is back at home recovering after undergoing surgery for a lipoma tumor that turned out to be benign.

The Real Housewives of Atlanta star, 51, tells PEOPLE that she went to the doctor after spotting an odd growth on her back.

“I noticed a slight raised lump on my back near my left shoulder blade about two months ago. At first I thought I had been bitten by something, or it was just back fat. A couple of weeks later, I noticed that it was still there and seemed to be growing,” she says in a statement.

Bailey’s doctor told her the growth was lipoma, a fatty tumor that grows in the body’s immune system, and she started to panic.

“I Googled it immediately, and was blown away by the photos of the worst cases in particular. I was scared because as soon as I heard the word tumor, I immediately thought cancer,” she says.

On Saturday, Bailey shared a photo from the doctor’s office and told her followers that she had an “early morning doctor appointment today. Had a little health scare. Thankfully I’m okay.”

Bailey set up surgery to remove the lipoma, and doctors were able to remove it, but with some difficulty. Thankfully, the tumor was not cancerous.

“Surgery went well, however it went much longer than expected because the tumor was embedded very deeply in my back and partially under a muscle,” she explains. “It was also larger than expected. In the end, thankfully all the lipoma was removed successfully, and it is benign.”

Bailey says she’s now back at her home, which she calls “Lake Bailey,” and recovering well.

“Thanks to everyone for all the well wishes, texts, and flowers,” she says.",real

""I just thought to myself, someone needs to show my fans and anybody that's looking at my account that what you see isn't always what's real,"" Lovato told E! News.

""And so, I decided to embrace my flaws and—I don't even like to call them flaws, it's just a part of who I am—and show the world that I'm imperfect, but that's what makes me beautiful.""

""There was nothing sensational that caused this divorce and nothing scandalous will surface,"" she explained. ""Big life decisions are hardest when made for the right reasons.

Fan favorite Colton Haynes — who just last month reprised his role as Roy Harper, to usher former leading lady Willa Holland off the canvas — is set to return to the superhero drama as a series regular for Season 7.

“We’re very fortunate and excited to welcome back Colton to Arrow,” the show’s executive producers said in a statement. “While we’ve always enjoyed Colton’s returns to the show, we couldn’t be more thrilled to have him return as a proper series regular — and we’re very excited about all the creative opportunities Roy Harper’s return affords us.”

Haynes in turn said, “I could not be happier to return to my role as Roy Harper alongside my Arrow family.”

For Haynes’ very recent Season 6 encore, Roy resurfaced in Star City just as Thea was met with a new threat. The two then left town with Nyssa al Ghul to find and destroy some Lazarus Pits. With Haynes now returning solo, should we start worrying about Thea’s fate?

“I would hope that he would be proud of the human being I am even if he didn’t like the art I am putting out,” she recently told E!. “That’s all I would ask of anyone in my life.”

Absolutely.”

Looks like everything is all good between Kendall Jenner and Scott Disick! The 22-year-old revealed on Instagram that she and Scott, 34, went skydiving together! She shared two photos to Instagram that showed the pair standing next to parachutes while strapped into skydiving gear. Kendall captioned the images, “did it!” to confirm that she and the father of her niece Penelope and nephews, Mason and Reign, did in fact jump out of an airplane together. Neat!

It was a bit surprising to see that these two crossed off a major bucket list item together since the supermodel totally dissed Scott’s relationship with Sofia Richie in January. It all started when a fan account for Kourtney Kardashian‘s ex shared a photo of him in a car with his 19-year-old girlfriend and his three children. Kendall’s verified account commented on the post, “awww scott and his kids.”

The shade continued into February when the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star shared an image of her new horse with the caption, “my new baby dragon.” This seemed innocuous enough, but fans were quick to notice that there may have been a subtle diss within the message. A month prior to the post, Sofia shared a throwback photo of herself hugging her horse, paired with the caption, “Rip to my beautiful dragon.

“Over two seasons, E!’s scripted series The Arrangement has taken viewers inside the world of an A-list movie star filled with secrets, scandal and romance,” a E! spokesperson said in a statement to Deadline. “While we have decided not to move forward with the series, we are incredibly grateful to the cast and our production partners.”

The Arrangement was one of two original scripted series on E! along with The Royals, whose fourth season aired alongside The Arrangement. The fate of that series, whose creator-showrunner Mark Schwahn was fired in December amid sexual harassment allegations, has not been decided.

On the scripted side, E! recently ordered the high-profile pilot Juicy Stories from Michael Patrick King.

The Arrangement was a breakout when it debuted in March 2017, averaging 1.3 million total viewers and 725,000 in the 18-49 demo in Live+3, and ranking as the year’s second-biggest scripted cable drama launch with young women (women 18-34). Its ratings slipped by double digits in Season 2, as did the ratings for its companion The Royals.

From Universal Cable Productions and writer/executive producer Jonathan Abrahams, The Arrangement starred Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista, Lexa Doig and Michael Vartan in a Hollywood love story shedding light on the darker side of fame.",real
-926663,Blac Chyna’s dream house includes a sex room,"Blac Chyna must be a “Fifty Shades of Grey” fan.

In a video for Architectural Digest, Chyna teamed up with Michael Lehrer of Lehrer Architects in Los Angeles to design what she’d imagine in her dream home. Her requests included an infinity pool, a 10-car garage, a Blac Chyna topiary and a helicopter pad — as well as a something a tad more unorthodox: a sex room.

“This might sound kind of crazy,” she told Lehrer. “I would also like to have a sex room. So, maybe like in my closet, and it’s, like, a button that I push and you can go in there — like a secret little room.”

The reality star also pitched the idea of including a recording studio in her home, which makes sense as Page Six previously reported she was trying to launch a rap career.

“She’s met with four labels … [is] collaborating with very big artists, and there’s going to be big news coming soon,” an insider said in September.

“Yes, she is trying to rap and no, [it’s] horrible,” the cynical music source sniffed. “All the majors are listening, and, sadly, she will likely get a deal. If she lands it, somebody will be stupid enough to give her a seven-figure advance.”",real

It’s their hilarious sense of humor that keeps things interesting between them, so naturally Teigen served up more feel-good jokes about her other half during her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show today.

Instead of flat-out roasting Legend, DeGeneres got Teigen to play a game called “You Don’t Know Jack About John” to see how much she really knew about her husband. The funny thing is, the audience could tell right off the bat that Teigen was struggling with the trivia.

“What was the name of the band John was a part of in the movie La La Land?,” DeGeneres asked her. “Oh, I know this one. The…The? It was corny,” Teigen replied.

“You’re halfway there with The…The Messengers,” DeGeneres said.

After getting most of the questions wrong, Teigen basically revealed that the problem is Legend keeps his work life pretty separate from their relationship. For example, Degeneres asked, “John performs on the soundtrack of which 50 Shades of Grey sequel?”

With the most confused look on her face, the model said she had no idea he’d done a song for 50 Shades, adding, “This is a big fight we always have… He doesn’t tell me about things he’s producing. We went to Sundance and he was like, ‘Oh, we’re showing my movie’ and I was like, ‘Your movie?! What are you talking about?!'”

At least when it came down to the personal questions she should know, like Legend’s middle name and what his old a capella group was called, Teigen nailed those answers.

“This is good. I wasn’t like a creepy stalker,” Teigen pointed out. “Yeah, you just love him for who he is,” DeGeneres added.

Once again, Teigen and Legend prove they’re one of the funniest pairs in Hollywood.",real

Thornton previously faced criticism for her decision to remarry less than two years after Carney’s death.

“There is no timeline for grief or for when God moves in your life in undeniable ways,” she said after her wedding, adding that Capaci “came along EXACTLY when God knew I needed him.”

“It wasn’t my choice to fall in love so quickly after Chris passed but I was growing so comfortable with being alone that it was becoming unhealthy,” Thornton continued. “When I say ‘Jo is the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me’ that in no way indicates that I didn’t love my first husband with all that I had. How dare any one of you judge me and say that on a social platform. It doesn’t make you any better of a person to cast judgment on others and sit in the seat of mockers. I will always love Chris and Jo knows that. And I will always love Jo. The beautiful thing about love is that it multiplies as new blessings come into your life.”",real

Let's start at the top: The song is essentially about Zayn asking someone to let him love them forever. He makes specific references at a number of points in the song, alluding to wanting ""walks on the beach in April,"" and ""duvet days and vanilla ice cream"" again. Elle has already pointed out that the beach walking thing could be referencing Gigi's birthday, which is in April. According to now-deleted Instagram pictures, the two spent celebrated her birthday in 2016, you guessed it, exploring the beach together.

However, while the lyrics are vague enough to keep fans speculating, what seems to be more obvious is his on-screen companion, model Sofia Jamora. Fans on social media have repeatedly noted that she looks strikingly similar to Gigi, between her middle-part blonde hairstyle to even some of her facial features. One person tweeted, ""and also does anyone else think the girl in 'let me' by zayn looks alot like Gigi Hadid?!""

She had gone there to meet him, she said, but was feeling woozy from a pill he gave her for menstrual cramps.

“His robe opened,” she testified during the fourth day of Mr. Cosby’s retrial on sexual assault charges. “He smelled like cigar and espresso and his body odor.”

Ms. Dickinson, 27 at the time, said the pill paralyzed her, and Mr. Cosby, then 45, seized the opportunity to sexually assault her.

It looks like Justin Bieber, 24, has moved on from Selena Gomez, 25… for now, at least. The singer was all smiles while out in Beverly Hills catching a workout class with his rumored new beau, Baskin Champion on April 12. The two apparent lovebirds met up at SoulCycle, where they both rocked baseball caps and causal and grey hooded sweatshirts. It looks like the singer and the model were working on their summer bods, and what better way to do it than with a partner, right? You know what they say — Couples that work out together, stay together. Check out the photos below!

Bieber and Champion’s workout meeting came after she was photographed arriving at his LA home on Wednesday, April 11. And, Champion already knew her way in since she’s been there before. As previously reported, the young model was spotted getting cozy with Bieber when the two attended the same concert back in March 2018. She was later photographed arriving at his house after the show.

Many fans thought the two were just friends after realizing that she is the sister or Bieber’s best friend’s girlfriend. Baskin’s sister, Abby Champion, is in a serious relationship with Patrick Schwarzenegger, 24, who’ve been dating for years. Nonetheless, Bieber continues to spend time with Baskin alone, stirring up those romance rumors.

As you may know, Bieber and Selena Gomez rekindled their on-and-off, years-long romance back in October 2017, after she split from The Weeknd, 28. The two were going strong until they decided to take a break in March 2017, right around Bieber’s 24th birthday [March 1]. However, that break seems like it’s permanent these days. We’ll have to wait and see!

Meanwhile, Sel has been hard at work on many of her acting projects including her very own franchise, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation, which she stepped out to promote on April 11.",real

""It's been crazy,"" York says to reporter Gadi Schwartz. ""I mean, it definitely gets you in places for free. I can't walk through a Las Vegas casino without someone yelling 'Yeah-Yeah!'""

Released in 1993, The Sandlot was set in 1962 and followed the summer of a group of neighborhood kids who played a never-ending baseball game and went head-to-head with the legend of a dog named ""The Beast."" The film became impactful for successful future athletes and was even recreated by the New York Yankees, who paid homage to the unforgettable Babe Ruth scene in the movie.

""The film was made with the same amount of love that people have for it, and it was the greatest summer of our lives,"" Evans says.

""It made a big impact on a lot of people's lives,"" Guiry says.

In one incriminating photo posted to The Shade Room's Instagram account, Union mysteriously pops up behind one of Thompson's alleged flings. But the actress wasted no time immediately shutting down the idea that she had anything to do with any of it.

""Don't know her. Didn't see her,"" Union wrote. ""I was enjoying my night with my mama and aunt. We ain't involved in this.""

Though it was reported that Kardashian was devastated upon hearing the news that Thompson may have been unfaithful, she has since been consumed by happiness upon the birth of her daughter, and People reports she is in the process of mending fences with her child's father.

“She’s basically already forgiven him,” a source said. “She is in a bubble of love and peace and happiness right now, and everything that happened with Tristan is less about ‘cheating’ and more like, it was just a random drunken hookup that meant nothing and was kissing at most and didn’t lead to anything else and was the fault of stupid groupies trying to trap him, and everybody just needs to move on.”",real

-927284,How Cardi B and Stylist Kollin Carter Hid That Baby Bump,"Carter says he was under the most pressure at the iHeartRadio Music Awards, as she was on national television, opening the show with a performance, and then had to change into an entirely different outfit afterward. Cardi was very much showing at the time, so Carter relied on tutus that night to hide her curves. As Carter explains, both the Moschino performance outfit, which melded a tutu and a peplum, and the super-voluminous oxblood-colored tulle Christian Siriano dress that she changed into afterward had people guessing whether Cardi was taking fashion risks or trying to hide something. “I feel like we got through it,” says Carter. “Toward the end there was a ton of speculation, but I don’t think she wore anything that was like, ‘Oh, my God, that’s her baby bump right there!’” And while it was a nerve-racking few months, Carter came to revel in it: “The process leading up to it was stressful, but afterward, I was like, this is kind of fun,” he says. “I have one of the biggest secrets in fashion and music, and in culture more generally, and we’re getting away with this every time. How cool is that?”

The process also left Carter with a deeper understanding of what it’s like for women in the public eye to try to keep parts of their lives private. “When it was just a rumor, to see her being criticized online with people saying things like, ‘You’re stupid. Your career is over. Why would you get pregnant at the peak of your career?’ I was just like, wow, I don’t feel like it’s fair that people try to make a call on when it is right or wrong for a woman to make a decision in regard to her own body,” Carter says, pointing out that male rappers have children all the time with little fanfare. “I couldn’t imagine going through that as a woman on a platform that big and remain standing, sticking with my decision. It takes a strong person to stick with that. She should be able to be the biggest artist that she wants to be and also have a family.”",real

The initiative is a way to honor the victims of the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting.

It's unclear where the gold pin initiative started, but each number carries its own significance: 851 is for the 851 people injured during the shooting on Oct. 1 at the 2017 Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Nev.; 58 is for the 58 people who were killed during the tragedy; and 1 represents unity.

""Life is a precious thing that goes by all too fast ... and when someone’s is taken from them too soon, i can only believe that it’s our responsibility to lift their memory up with love as much as we can.""

The 2018 ACM Awards ceremony will include an onstage tribute to the victims of the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting as well. The show's producers have indicated that the moment will open the awards show, and that they worked with Jason Aldean -- who was onstage at Route 91 when the shooting began -- to put the tribute together.

-927653,Carrie Coon Joins ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ as Villain,"“Fargo” and “The Leftovers” actress Carrie Coon is the latest name added to the vast official cast of Marvel Studios’ upcoming “Avengers: Infinity War.” Coon voices Proxima Midnight, a member of villain Thanos’ Black Order, in the ensemble superhero movie, which opens worldwide from April 25.

The news of Coon’s participation was revealed by “Infinity War” directors Joe and Anthony Russo in an interview with British magazine Radio Times. Having reconfirmed that Irish actor Tom Vaughn-Lawlor was voicing fellow Black Order member Ebony Maw, the brothers were asked if they could reveal “any other interesting voices in the Black Order.” “Carrie Coon is Proxima Midnight,” Joe Russo said.

The actress confirmed the news Monday on Twitter, also revealing she had performed facial motion capture for the role. Coon wrote: “It’s true! My voice and a dazzle of gifted animators have teamed up to play Proxima Midnight. To be fair my face is in there somewhere. #MoCapWhilePregnant.”

The in-demand actress has also recently completed production on “Kin,” directed by Jonathan and Josh Baker, and Steve McQueen’s Chicago-set crime drama “Widows.”

-927654,Nikki Bella's Ex-Husband: Find out About Her First Marriage!,"



She has a secret past! Nikki Bella knew that her longtime love John Cena had an aversion to marriage because his first marriage ended in a nasty divorce — but she didn’t let that stop her from pursuing a relationship with him. And it turns out that their pasts are pretty similar — just like John, Nikki also was previously married and went through a divorce. Keep reading below to find out more about Nikki’s ex-husband.

Nikki kept her marriage a secret for nearly a decade and she actually revealed the details to her family on a previous season of Total Divas. “I got married when I was 20 and got divorced at 23 to my high school sweetheart,” she said. “Basically, we got married by Elvis. We drove to Vegas, did it, and even when I started walking down the aisle, I know this was a huge mistake [like] how can I get out of it, and I couldn’t and I tried to forget about it.”

Nikki’s mom Kathy Colace was shocked that she kept such a big secret from her for all those years and Nikki said that it was because she was ashamed of the whole situation. But her family weren’t the only ones in the dark — she hadn’t even told John at that point. She was worried about breaking the news to him because they’ve had multiple conversations about marriage before and she never mentioned her own previous marriage to him.

But Nikki eventually gathered enough courage to tell John at her sister Brie Bella’s 2014 wedding to her husband Daniel Bryan. She revealed to John that she had previously been married for three years and he was extremely forgiving and understanding — probably because he was also previously married to his high school sweetheart and got divorced after only three years, too.

“I don’t care,” he told her. “What you did before you met me is what you did before you met me, I don’t need to know everything about you. It’s just when you can tell other people and I kind of would like to be on that totem pole somewhere — I don’t have to be at the top, I just would like to be on it.”",real

-927792,Are Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright Broken Up? Update,"As Season 6 of Vanderpump Rules came to an end, there were some big changes happening in Jax Taylor's life. The model/bartender had been fired from SUR by Lisa Vanderpump — and also his relationship with Brittany Cartwright ended as well. Their breakup, a decision he made (or, as Shep Rose recently called it, the ""reverse projection""), came after a pretty tumultuous season as Brittany grappled with Jax's infidelity. And this is how Brittany dealt with the split: ""I was trying to do my own thing, but he crept his way back into my heart again,"" she shared with E!'s Daily Pop this week about the aftermath of that split (clip above).

So, how did Jax win his longtime love back? ""He was very persistent and did not give up,"" Brittany explained to E! this week. ""There [were] some times, sorry to say this Jax, but I would have like 30 missed calls from him. He just wasn't going to give up on me. And I knew that I loved him still. I was trying to act like I didn't, but in the end, I'm just so glad that we are where we are now. We are so much better than we ever have been. I don't know, maybe we should have broke up sooner so that we could have gotten to this point sooner.""

Another pivotal moment in their relationship and Jax's growth came as he was dealing with his dad's illness. His father died in December after battling cancer. Brittany added, ""That opened Jax's eyes as well.""

-927944,John Cena Devastated After Nikki Bella Split: It’s The ‘Worst Day Ever’ — See Message,"Just hours after John Cena and Nikki Bella announced their split, he took to Instagram to share a sad message about how he’s feeling in the aftermath of the breakup. See it here.

John Cena always shares memes, quotes and photos on Instagram with no explanation, but he didn’t need a caption for us to know what he was referring to with this post from Sunday night, April 15. The WWE star shared a meme from The Simpsons that read “Worst Day Ever” in capital letters, and it went up on his page shortly after he and his fiancee, Nikki Bella, confirmed to Us Weekly that they’d be ending their relationship after six years together. “While this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for each other,” they said. “We ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives.”

The split announcement came as quite a shock, as Nikki and John just attended the WWE Hall of Fame Induction together on April 6, and were photographed kissing on the red carpet. She also supported him at the premiere of his movie, Blockers, earlier this month. However, there were some suspicions back in March, when Nikki didn’t show up to the Kids’ Choice Awards, which John was hosting for the second year in a row. The shocking split comes just over a year after John famously proposed to Nikki at WrestleMania on April 2, 2017.

After years of insisting that he would never get married again (John’s first marriage to Elizabeth Huberdeau ended in divorce in 2012), John got down on one knee at the WWE’s biggest event of the year and presented Nikki with a gigantic diamond ring. Their destination wedding was reportedly set for May 5, according to People.

-928095,‘The Originals’ to End After Season 5 on The CW,"The CW series “The Originals” will end after its upcoming fifth season.

Showrunner Julie Plec made the announcement on Twitter on Thursday ahead of the series’ San Diego Comic-Con panel later this week. Plec said it was only fitting to make the announcement one year after announcing the end of the series’ parent program, “The Vampire Diaries.”

“It’s both a gift and a burden to be able to control the ending of a series,” Plec wrote. “Many shows are not lucky enough to have a hand in deciding when the end has come.” Read her full statement below.

Fans will be able to attend a panel Q&A with the cast and creators on Saturday, July 22, at 12 p.m. PT at the Indigo Ballroom in the Hilton San Diego Bayfront Hotel.

“The Originals” follows Joseph Morgan’s Klaus Mikaelson and his family in New Orleans. Morgan stars alongside Daniel Gillies, Phoebe Tonkin, Charles Michael Davis, Yusuf Gatewood and Riley Voelkel. Plec serves as executive producer with Leslie Morgenstein. The series hails from Bonanza Productions Inc., My So-Called Company, Alloy Entertainment, Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios.

The show was one of several renewals for The CW for the 2017-2018 season. The other renewals were “iZombie,” “Arrow,” “D.C.’s Legends of Tomorrow,” “The Flash,” “Supergirl,” “Jane the Virgin,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and “Supernatural.” The network cancelled freshman series “No Tomorrow” and “Frequency.”

It was spun off from “The Vampire Diaries” in 2013. “Vampire Diaries” wrapped up earlier this year after eight seasons and 171 episodes.

The legendary performer walked her first red carpet since 2013 on Tuesday night, attending the opening night performance of “Tina: The Tina Turner Musical” at London’s Aldwych Theatre.

Dressed in a sharp black jacket and matching slacks, Turner, 78, accessorized with sheer gloves, a statement clutch and husband Erwin Bach on her arm.

And while Turner has made appearances over the years, she was last photographed on the red carpet five years ago at Giorgio Armani’s “One Night Only” event in Rome.

The musical, starring American actress Adrienne Warren, 30, has already received rave reviews from the British press, as well as Turner herself.

“Well first of all, it’s difficult to see someone else do what we did for 40 years. I’m a perfectionist, so I look a little bit critically,” Turner recently told BBC. “But when I look and see it done so well, I feel proud.”

Before marrying Bach five years ago, Turner experienced a tumultuous marriage to Ike Turner from 1962 to 1978. The singer said she has since forgiven her former spouse for years of physical abuse.

“As an old person, I have forgiven him, but it would not work with him,” Turner told The Sunday Times earlier this year. “He asked for one more tour with me, and I said, ‘No, absolutely not.’ Ike wasn’t someone you could forgive and allow him back in. It’s all gone, all forgotten.”

-928271,How the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge keep their kids’ lives normal?,"As members of the British royal family, it’s hard to imagine that Princess Charlotte, Prince George, and Prince Louis live ordinary lives. But to our surprise, they do.

And, it’s true.

According to some new and special reports, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Kate and William do everything they can to ensure that their three children live as normal lives as possible.

A royal insider, told The Royal UK that:-

“Prince William and Kate Middleton very much prioritize bringing up their lovely children in as normal as environment as possible”.

Apparently, this kind of normality takes precedence throughout the day, and starts from first thing in the morning. Some reports suggest that Prince George is driven to his school, Thomas’s of Battersea in London, by either his mother or his father.

Meanwhile, Princess Charlotte, whose nursery is within walking distance of the family home, is walked there by one of her parents too.

Instead of enlisting a member of staff with these duties, the royal couple, William and Kate endeavour to put their children first.









Same kind of normality is there at their home too.

When it comes to their home in Kensington Palace’s Apartments, Charlotte is apparently a great hostess. As per our royal source: “She’ll come up to guests and ask them if they want tea or coffee or offer them sweets”.

This isn’t the first time that Kate and William have seen trying to keep their children’s lives normal. Earlier this month, Kate was spotted doing some back-to-school shopping with the kids, as they looked for new school shoes.

-928419,I Feel Pretty review: Amy Schumer's body-positive comedy is cruel and self-defeating,"Dirs: Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein. Cast: Amy Schumer, Michelle Williams, Busy Philipps, Naomi Campbell, Aidy Bryant, Emily Ratajkowski. 12A cert, 110 mins

Amy Schumer doesn’t need too many excuses to be funny, and she certainly doesn’t need the trumped-up self-body-shaming of I Feel Pretty, her new vehicle as a producer and star. The film wants it both ways: to reject the unattainable hierarchies of the beauty industry, but also to ridicule a person who doesn’t know her place within them.

The only means it can find to be funny is sabotaging its own message, which isn’t a great starting point, let alone finishing point, for a body-positive comedy.

Renée (Schumer) is a minor employee at a scarily top-end New York cosmetics firm. She’s as far from front-of-house as could be imagined, sifting through web orders in a dingy basement that's miles from the gleaming HQ uptown. And she hates the way she looks, trapped in a state of precarious mental health which can’t be helped by her choice of employer.

Brought to mind in a scene when she watches Big (1988) are the high-concept comedies of the 1980s. One of these might have decided to port Renée into someone else’s physique – say, the lissom style princess played here by Michelle Williams – and watched them grapple with their change in fortunes.",real

“I’m knocked up!” she jokingly announced on Wednesday’s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

The 39-year-old actress revealed she was in her first trimester of pregnancy while filming her hit drama, calling the time her “least favorite phase.”

“You just feel horrible. You just feel rotten and you’re not allowed to say why,” she explained to host Fallon. “I was filming quite a lot and just inadvertently falling asleep all the time. It was just embarrassing.”

Revealing she “face planted” onto a crocheted bag in between takes, Danes noted that she had a rude awakening when it was time for her close up.

“I have this crocheted indentation all on the side of my face. It looked like I had third degree burns,” she said of the marks. “They were massaging my face. They had to get out the blow dryer. I halted production for a good half an hour. I felt like an idiot.”

These days, she’s in the “cruisy second trimester.”

“It gets a little excited when I have a chocolate bar. It’s moving and kicking,” she said of her second child. “I love that part. It’s like a fireworks show every so often. It’s really cool and a little creepy. It is, it’s like an alien being in there, cohabitating, yeah, AirBNB.”

Danes announced her second pregnancy during Howard Stern’s SiriusXM show on Wednesday after being asked about the love scenes on Homeland, which airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Showtime.

The actress and her husband, Hugh Dancy, are already parents to 5-year-old son Cyrus.

While Scandals may blow over, co-stars may die, and even living content well Shonda Rhimes might depart for richer, more digital pastures, the core crew at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital continues to soldier on. Variety reports that ABC has just renewed its functionally unkillable medical drama Grey’s Anatomy for a landmark 15th season, officially making the show the network’s longest-running primetime drama series ever.

Still starring Ellen Pompeo as Meredith Grey, a woman who has seen some serious shit by this point, the show remains one of ABC’s highest-rated offerings despite its advancing years. Hence, presumably, why the network continues to renew the series, even after creator Rhimes announced last year that she was jumping ship to start developing shows for Netflix. (Rhimes will continue to serve as a producer on Grey’s and her other ABC shows for as long as they continue to run, although it’s worth noting that Krista Vernnoff is the series’ actual showrunner.)

While Harry was making his way down a line of fans welcoming him and pregnant wife Meghan to Melbourne, a choir was getting ready for him to get close enough to break out into a rendition of “Stand By Me,” the couple’s royal wedding song.

Leading up to the moment, which was planned by Brendan Fevola of Fox FM, an Australian radio show, the choir took off their jackets and revealed white T-shirts featuring one of Harry and Meghan’s engagement photos in a heart. Then as they started to sing the 1961 Ben E. King tune, Harry caught on and asked, “Who’s singing?”

Once he spotted the choir, he smiled, laughed and even danced for a few moments. Harry also placed his hand by his ear, encouraging them to sing louder.

“Much better than the original!” he joked, making a reference to the gospel choir, Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir, that sang the song for their May wedding.

“We don’t know how Fev managed to pull off greeting Meghan and Harry with a choir singing their wedding song! THIS WAS AMAZING!!” tweeted the radio show.

Harry and Meghan arrived holding hands to meet thousands gathered on the grounds of the city’s Royal Botanic Gardens on Thursday morning.

The crowd had a serious case of royal fever greeting the couple, with one girl in particular breaking down in (very happy!) tears after Harry gave her a big hug.

This certainly doesn’t come as a surprise. Two weeks ago, it was reported that she and fellow original cast member Patrick J.

USA Network and Universal Cable Productions released the following statement: “From all of us at USA Network and Universal Cable Productions, we want to send our most heartfelt congratulations to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on their engagement. Meghan has been a member of our family for seven years and it has been a joy to work with her.

-929988,Florida Georgia Line Loves Writing Songs Other Artists Record,"Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line are not only singers, they are also song writers. The duo loves it when other artists record songs they have written.

Tyler and Brian have written many of their own hit songs. However, they have had hits they wrote recorded by other artists like Jason Aldean‘s “Burnin’ It Down” and “You Make It Easy” as well as Cole Swindell‘s “Hope You Get Lonely Tonight,” just to name a few. The songwriter in them gets excited when they hear those songs sung by another artist.

“There’s just something special about hearing another artist sing a song that we were a part of writing,” Tyler admits, “and somehow just kind of putting their stamp on it and saying I believe in this song. That just means a lot to us as songwriters.”

That doesn’t mean they don’t get satisfaction from having a hit song that they both wrote and recorded. It is just something different seeing another artist having success with a song they wrote.

“Whether it’s an FGL song or, probably even more exciting, someone else singing one of our songs, it’s always rewarding,” Tyler states. “It never gets old and it’s pretty amazing.”

Tyler and Brian teamed with Michael Hardy and Mark Holman to write their current single titled “Simple.” The song has reached the top five this week on the country radio airplay singles charts. It could become the duo’s next chart topper as singer-songwriters in the coming weeks.

Here’s to more success for Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley as both singers and songwriters in the future.

Downey was joined by a former Russian spy (Scarlett Johansson), a God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth), and one who “fought in World War II,” (Chris Evans).

In comes Chris Pratt, claiming Star-Lord as “the greatest to ever walk the Earth, by far.” Anthony Mackie and Benedict Cumberbatch sang their own introductions — a falcon and a magic doctor, respectively — while Chadwick Boseman kept it sweet and simple, singing, “Wakanda Forever.”

“So then one day all the heroes were assembled, to fight a villain who packed much more than a punch,” the cast chorused. “And this group was labeled the Avengers, that’s the way we all became the Marvel Bunch.”

The super crew got a last minute addition from the one and only Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who punctuated the song with a signature “Hello, brother,” thrown Hemsworth’s way. “Shut up!” Hemsworth pitched back from his own Brady Bunch box.

Staci has spoken! By now, you’ve all heard Miranda Lambert has declared she is “happily single,” but you might not know how Staci Felker feels about it.

While she didn’t outwardly address her now ex husband’s split from Lambert, she did take to social media to defend him right before news of the split went public.

But keep in mind, the Turnpike Troubadours canceled their final two shows on Miranda’s tour BEFORE news of the breakup surfaced, so we are 99.99999 percent sure Staci was already aware of the breakup when she responded to a fan on Instagram.

Here’s how it all went down:

An Instagrammer decided to tell Staci she should remove all the photos of Evan from her social accounts.

Staci seemed to frown upon that idea.

According to Fox News, Staci responded by saying that Evan and his family will always mean something to her.

She went on to say she is very appreciative for the advice, but she has nothing but well wishes for Evan and his band.

She also revealed that a “wife’s love” doesn’t just fade away after six months, referring to the time her and Evan have been broken up.

Hmmm …

What do you think her comments mean?

Over the last six months, there has been a tremendous amount of drama surrounding Staci, so her response was definitely unexpected.

Do you think her and Evan are in the midst of getting back together?

The season has a few winter Olympians such as Tonya Harding, Jamie Anderson, Mirai Nagasu, Chris Mazdzer and of course, Rippon. There are also some team sports players like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and former MLB outfielder Johnny Damon.



In this first week, the couples dance to the foxtrot, salsa, cha-cha-cha, or the waltz. The couples were evaluated both by the judges and from a live voting audience at home. For the first time in the show, two couples were eliminated on the opening episode. (Spoilers ahead!)



Luckily, Rippon wasn’t one of the two couples. In fact, he was one of the top couples of the week. It’s been a dream for the Olympian to be on the show, so I’m sure it feels great that he performed well.



Before we get into the dance, we have to talk about his introduction video. The first 10 seconds of the clip where Adam meets his partner, Jenna Johnson, is just them screaming and hugging. ""It was destiny,"" he says.



“Adam and I, when we first met, I was amazed because I felt like we had known each other for years,” Jenna explained in the clip. “Immediately, there was just a connection and a chemistry.”



I need to get a drink of water before we discuss how amazing his freaking performance was. If I hadn’t seen him plastered all over Twitter for like a month, I wouldn’t have been able to tell which one was the celebrity and which one was the professional dancer.

He says ever since he and Kim posted video seemingly showing Taylor knew about his infamous ""Famous"" lyric ahead of time ... his relationship with radio has never been the same.

He admits he wanted major radio play as one of the most popular artists in the world, and says the fact he simply wasn't getting it after he released 'Life of Pablo' screwed with his head.

Kanye also notes that the departure of L.A. Reid from Universal Music might've affected his radio dynamic ... but says it was just one of many stressors in his life at that point.

The 54-year-old War Machine actor made his return to Comedy Central’s The Jim Jefferies Show as his bleak weatherman persona. What was he morbidly musing about this time? Climate change.

“We’ve got sunshine in the west, the south, the east, and over here in the north, the ice caps are melting and I am so so so so scared,” he said.

“Didn’t we fire you?” host Jim Jefferies asked. They did. After making his debut as the weatherman in 2017, Pitt’s character was later “fired” for being “crazy” and “a real nutjob.”

These memories started flooding back as he tried telling a joke involving basketball star LeBron James. “I was hanging out with LeBron James, and he said, ‘How’s the weather down there?’ because he’s tall,” he began. “And I said, ‘Same as it is up there: changing at a pace not before seen in the history of man. Your legacy is pointless. Our people and our memories will all burn.'”

Creator Mitch Hurwitz revealed on social media that he’s recut the entire season and will be releasing it on Netflix as Arrested Development Season 4 Remix: Fateful Consequences.

The original Season 4 focused on one character per episode. “The goal was that by the end of the season a unified story of cause and effect would emerge for the viewer — full of surprises about how the Bluths were responsible for most of the misery they had endured,” Hurwitz wrote.

Netflix

In between Season 4 and the upcoming Season 5, Hurwitz said he recut the season, “shuffling the content from 15 individualized stories into 22 interwoven stories the length of the original series,” admittedly to see if he “could make some money” in eventual syndication. But also, he said, as a comedic experiment to see if new jokes and a new perspective would emerge from a remix that features all the Bluths in every episode, and where the simultaneity of the story plays out chronologically.”

The recut version will begin streaming May 4 on Netflix. Hurwitz also noted that Season 5 will be coming soon.

The man had been involved in a standoff with a SWAT team for hours after police tried to serve a warrant.

CBS Los Angeles reports that the standoff began shortly before 7 a.m., when police tried to serve a warrant at 42-year-old Joshua Corbett's home. Police told the station that the SWAT team was called because of the suspect's threat of violence to police.

Hours later, LAPD Officer Tony Im said the standoff had ended early Wednesday afternoon and Corbett had been found dead of a ""self-inflicted injury."" Corbett was under probation for breaking into Bullock's home while she was inside in June 2014. He was convicted and sentenced to five years probation for stalking the actress.

During the incident, Bullock called 911 while hiding in a bedroom closet, telling a dispatcher a stranger had broken into her home.

Legend began his performance by strutting onstage solo in an all-white ensemble and bedazzled moto jacket, but was quickly flanked by a squad of dancers including what looked like a few elementary-schoolers. As he launched into the song’s starry-eyed chorus, crooning “I think I just met my wife,” Tyra Banks, Ciara and others could be spotted singing along in their seats. By the song’s end, the entire crowd was on their feet.

Notably absent from the scene was Teigen herself, though for good reason: the 32-year-old model and cookbook connoisseur gave birth to her and Legend’s second child just days earlier. When awards show host Kelly Clarkson returned to reclaim the stage, she was quick to congratulate Legend on the baby boy, named Miles Theodore Stephens, as a photo of the newborn flashed on the stage projectors.

“E! will not be moving forward with another season of The Royals, which launched in 2015 as the network’s first original scripted series,” a spokesperson for the network said in a statement. “Over four seasons, The Royals took viewers behind the palace gates on a scandalous journey filled with twists and turns. We are grateful to the cast and our producing partners at Lionsgate and Universal Cable Productions.”

According to our sister site Deadline, Lionsgate is currently shopping the series to other networks, with the possibility of Pop picking up the show for Season 5.

The Royals starred Elizabeth Hurley as Queen Helena, left a widow following the tragic murder of King Simon in the show’s first season. The Royals also starred William Moseley as Prince Liam, Alexandra Park as Princess Eleanor, Max as Prince King Robert, Tom Austen as Jasper and Jake Maskall as Cyrus.

The Royals‘ fourth (and final) season ended with Robert marrying Willow, Eleanor and Jasper getting pre-engaged, Liam and Kathryn discussing the future of (gasp!) their baby, and Cyrus at last reuniting with Violet. Helena also kicked her latest boy toy out of her bed… but that’s nothing to celebrate.

Many fans suspected that The Royals wasn’t long for this world when creator/showrunner Mark Schwahn was investigated — and eventually fired — over allegations of sexual harassment. More than 20 members of the show’s cast and crew, including Park, released a statement in November accusing Schwahn of misconduct.

Coupled with The Arrangement‘s cancellation in May, The Royals‘ axing leaves E! with no scripted programming currently on the air, though the cable net did hand a pilot order to the dramedy Juicy Stories in March.

Klein's eyelid wasn't closing right during a post-operation visit, but it was passed off as a result of swelling, according to the lawsuit.

The condition worsened over time and Klein said in court documents that he was referred by Nassif to some of his colleagues who blamed his inability to blink on a pre-existing condition.

Klein eventually learned that a medial canthal tendon was displaced when Nassif broke his nasal bone during the surgery, according to the lawsuit.

While she's not stepping out onto red carpets and making appearances at talk shows, she's out and about in New York shooting a campaign up on the Upper West Side for watch brand Longines.

In the latest shots (she was wrangling an armful of dogs yesterday for a different shoot), she paired a Blair Waldorf-approved thick headband with a statement-making LBD from Stella McCartney that featured oversized shoulders and a nipped waist, a signature Dior swerve since the brand debuted its Bar Jacket back in the 1940s. She added a pair of Ray-Ban wayfarers to complete the look, which was all black (she's in New York, after all) and tiptoed into goth territory, though it was more sleek and stealthy than Victorian mourning attire. The look also featured tiny earrings and little kitten-heeled mules.

Speaking about her new movie, Lawrence continued to be a relatable queen by saying that between takes, she was simply hanging out and eating grilled cheese sandwiches.



""She’s hilarious and she’s a Dior model who is like a full dummy in the best possible way. During a break, she’d be like, ‘I’m going to get grilled cheese.

After sitting out last year's Met Gala, Sarah Jessica Parker returned to the event on Monday night — and she brought her A-game.

Parker wore a ruffled gold and silver gown with a dramatic train. She topped off her ensemble with loads of blue eyeshadow and a flower tucked behind her ear. But the one thing that really stole the show was her combination headband and hat, which was actually a depiction of the Nativity scene.

Just five months after Colton Haynes filed for divorce from husband Jeff Leatham, the pair shared gushy tributes to each other to mark their one-year wedding anniversary on Sunday.

The seemingly reunited couple tied the knot in front of 120 guests at a nighttime ceremony held at a Palm Springs hotel last October, with the wedding officiated by their longtime friend Kris Jenner.

Six months after tying the knot, the Arrow actor cited irreconcilable difference as the reason for their separation in divorce documents, listing their official date of separation as May 1, 2018.

On Sunday, Haynes wrote on Instagram, “Can’t believe it’s already been 1 yr. since we got married @jeffleatham.”

Alongside some wedding photos, Haynes continued, “Happy Anniversary my beautiful husband,” adding three heart emojis.

In a matching post — also featuring wedding photos — Leatham, 47, shared his own tribute to Haynes, 30.

“I can’t remember what it was like before you, and I don’t even know how we got here but maybe that’s exactly what I needed,” he said. “Someone who could make me forget where I came from and someone who could make me love without knowing how to fall. R.M. Drake – Happy Anniversary My Beautiful Husband.”

Continued Leatham, “Life is a beautiful place with you beside me. – I LOVE YOU.”

Despite their split in May, Haynes and Leatham were spotted out together in the months that followed. Haynes and Leatham were photographed walking through LAX together in July. The two kept a low profile during the outing, with Leatham turning his head away from the cameras.

Scarlett Johansson made the most controversial outfit decision at last night’s Met Gala, and it didn’t even involve a Pope hat. The actress, who was accompanied by her official boyfriend Colin Jost, wore a pink-and-red tulle gown designed by Marchesa, the line founded by Harvey Weinstein’s ex-wife Georgina Chapman. This marks the first time a major celebrity has worn Marchesa to a red carpet event since the Weinstein allegations broke.

Once a red-carpet staple, Marchesa saw its popularity plummet in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, especially after stories suggested that Weinstein had pressured actresses in his films to wear his wife’s dresses. But recently Marchesa has made efforts to rehabilitate its image, with co-founder Keren Craig telling Refinery29 that the brand wants to support the #MeToo movement.

In a quote provided to the Cut, Johansson said that she wore Marchesa because she wanted to show her support for the women behind the brand. “I wore Marchesa because their clothes make women feel confident and beautiful and it is my pleasure to support a brand created by two incredibly talented and important female designers,” she said. Endorsing Chapman’s line appears to be Johansson’s tacit way of saying that women shouldn’t be penalized for the crimes of the men in their lives, something that many #MeToo supporters will likely be able to get on board with.

“We are truly honored that Scarlett chose to wear Marchesa for the Met Gala,” said Marchesa in a statement. “She is an amazingly talented actor who has incredible style and presence. It was wonderful to work so closely with her in creating this custom look.”

Jordan discussed friction with his NFL sibling during his stint on Season 12 of ABC’s long-running dating competition, and chatter surrounding the Rodgers family feud appeared to intensify after Ed spoke with the New York Times in January.

“Aaron has never wanted to air this out in a public forum. He’s going through great precautions not to make this worse,” a source close to Aaron told People earlier this year. “You’re not going to see him on Oprah crying about all of this. He will deal with his family issues privately.”

The quarterback’s former girlfriend, actress Olivia Munn, was said to be at the center of familial tensions. But even after their split in April, it appears Aaron and the Rodgers kin have yet to mend fences.

“Aaron still hasn’t been in contact with his family,” an insider told US Weekly in June. “His mom, Darla, has reached out to him multiple times in the last few months, but hasn’t heard back from him.”

Jordan previously stated he hopes to have his family in attendance at his future nuptials.

“Absolutely. There’s no scenario in which I wouldn’t want my entire family at a wedding,” Jordan said in 2016. “That’s something all of our family wants and hopes for at some point.”",real

The actress took to Instagram to casually drop a cute AF Christmas photo on us all, showing off her love, Chris Adkins. ""Happy Holidays"" she simply wrote in the caption of the picture she shared where the couple looks oh so in love, smiling from ear to ear cuddling up next to each other in front of a Christmas tree.

How precious! The grown-ish star then took to her Instagram story to share a cute video of the pair hanging out in the snow together.

Seriously so in love! So who is this lucky guy? Well, Chris happens to be a cinematographer on the show black-ish, and since grown-ish is the spinoff series of the ABC comedy series, it's only natural Francia and Chris met through their mutual connections, namely Yara Shahidi, who apparently helped the two get together. A source told E! News the pair has been dating for a few months now and added, ""she is very happy with him.""

Francia had a rather intense 2017 since underwent surgery and donated one of her kidneys to her dear friend Selena Gomez. While recovering from the procedure, she has been busy working and now the premiere of grown-ish is right around the corner. So while she was saving her bestie's life and slaying the acting game, she managed to find love too. And if anyone deserves to have a great guy by her side, it's Francia. Who knows, maybe they'll go on double dates with Sel and Justin Bieber now. We can only hope, tbh.

“But it’s wrong to be married and be unhappy and stay,” Kirke, 32, added.

Kirke and Mosberg divorced after seven years of marriage. They have two children together.

Kirke — whose solo exhibition of oil paintings, which is running at downtown gallery Sargent’s Daughters through Jan. 21, is a commentary on weddings and marriage — told the magazine that she doesn’t particularly enjoy weddings unless they’re “fun.”

“No,” she answered when asked if she had fun at hers. “I mean, it was fine, it was quick, it was simple, but it was pointless. Either you’re throwing a party, or you’re doing it out of necessity.”

Despite her strong opinions on marriage, Kirke said she “might” get married again.

Everything that makes her special was on display in a recent photoshoot for InStyle in which Drew recreated her iconic childhood photos, and we can’t get enough of it.

It’s pretty nuts that Drew has been in the public eye for the vast majority of her life — who else could carry a movie when they were only three? And while her childhood may have been tumultuous, her fashion was always on point.

A total ’80s baby and ’90s kid, Drew’s wild, bright clothing was the perfect way for a precocious and love-filled child to express herself. The fact that she still has that child-like sparkle in her eye even as an adult speaks to her lightness of being and joyous spirit.

It doesn’t get much better than the recreation of these gorgeous throwback photos. Her fairy tale childhood was definitely a unique experience, and these photos are a window into her singular experiences.

We can’t get enough of all the InStyle photos — even as a tiny kid Drew Barrymore had impeccable style.

What do we have to do to get that wild and fancy-free hair?

Who among us didn’t have a flower-embroidered bucket hat back in the day? Drew makes it look better than we ever could, TBH.

We have to admit that fancy-baby Drew Barrymore is our favorite.

This photo captures how surreal and fantasy-like her childhood really was. Drew looks so wise as her younger self — and even more so now. That inner beauty is just always shining through.

These are the ultimate #TBT.

I have learned to focus on HELPING you to BLOSSOM into what YOU want to be (into what you were born to be)... Rather than Demanding that you become what my Fragile Ego needs you to be.”

Impressed? Hold on. He’s just getting started.

“I’ve learned to take pleasure in Nourishing YOUR dreams... Rather than wrestling with you to Fulfill my Selfish Needs & Satiate My Insecurities,” he continued. “I have learned that Love is Listening. Love is Giving. Love is Freedom.”

And what have we learned? That Will Smith has a way with words. And that he really loves his wife (and their son Jaden and daughter Willow).

“Happy Anniversary, My Queen! I am forever Devoted to Nurturing your Deepest Truth,” the actor wrote.

As far as anniversary messages go, this one’s pretty special. Our only question is, how are you going to top yourself next year, Will?

Congrats to you and Jada on your milestone day!",real

Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban threw shade all the way from Nashville to Times Square on New Year's Eve when Andy Cohen asked the couple a slightly controversial question during CNN's live broadcast.

The power couple called in from Nashville and talked to Cohen and his co-host, Anderson Cooper, when Cohen asked them about Kidman's famous clapping from the 2017 Oscars and whether they expected it to become a popular meme.

""I mean, it's called a logical clap when you don't want to slam your hands together with rings,"" Urban replied after a brief pause, ""but what do you want to do?""

The Oscar-winning actress then added, ""I wish that there was more important things to be concerned about or that people were focused on more important things than that sort of clapping. That's what I would say.""

Things became a bit more awkward when Urban lost his ear piece while trying to show Cohen and Cooper the crowd in Nashville, where Urban was performing for the city's New Year's Eve celebration, and couldn't hear the interviewers.

Luckily, the interview ended on an amicable note with everyone wishing each other a happy New Year. After the call ended, Cohen realized Kidman had given him a little jab.

""That was amazing. That was so cool that Nicole Kidman joined in,"" Cohen said. ""I think she just shaded me a little bit.""

""Well yeah, she did. Yes,"" Cooper agreed.

""I guess she's not coming on my show,"" the Watch What Happens Live host concluded.

Cooper seemed to understand Kidman's viewpoint. In a tweet, he described her comments as ""some well deserved shade.""

The CNN anchor then mentioned that Cohen has lots of celebrity guests on his Bravo talk show.

""Not Nicole Kidman,"" Cohen responded.",real

-902992,Powerful Hollywood Women Unveil Anti-Harassment Action Plan,"Driven by outrage and a resolve to correct a power imbalance that seemed intractable just months ago, 300 prominent actresses and female agents, writers, directors, producers and entertainment executives have formed an ambitious, sprawling initiative to fight systemic sexual harassment in Hollywood and in blue-collar workplaces nationwide.

The initiative includes:

— A legal defense fund, backed by $13 million in donations, to help less privileged women — like janitors, nurses and workers at farms, factories, restaurants and hotels — protect themselves from sexual misconduct and the fallout from reporting it.

— Legislation to penalize companies that tolerate persistent harassment, and to discourage the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims.

— A drive to reach gender parity at studios and talent agencies that has already begun making headway.

— And a request that women walking the red carpet at the Golden Globes speak out and raise awareness by wearing black.

Called Time’s Up, the movement was announced on Monday with an impassioned pledge of support to working-class women in an open letter signed by hundreds of women in show business, many of them A-listers. The letter also ran as a full-page ad in The New York Times, and in La Opinion, a Spanish-language newspaper.

“The struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard and acknowledged in male-dominated workplaces must end; time’s up on this impenetrable monopoly,” the letter says.",real

The album is due Feb. 2 — two days before his halftime performance on the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.

“This album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any album I’ve ever written, where I’m from — it’s personal,” he says in the video, which is filled with shots of Timberlake in outdoors settings. In other shots he is seen working with Pharrell Williams, who says “It feels so earthy, it’s just where you are in your life right now,” before adding emphatically, “That is a smash,” presumably about a song. Snippets of two or three new songs play in the background during the video.

While the wintery scenes contrast with Timberlake’s upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, he has been saying for some months that the album, on which he also worked with longtime collaborators Max Martin and Shellback (with whom he collaborated on his last single, the hit “Can’t Stop the Feeling” from the movie “Trolls”) and Timbaland, reflected his roots, calling it “Southern American music.”

Seth Meyers will take the stage as host of the 2018 Golden Globe Awards. The 44-year-old host of Late Night with Seth Meyers recently told PEOPLE how he planned to handle the hosting gig in the wake of the sexual harassment scandals that have rocked Hollywood in recent months.

Be sure to check out PEOPLE’s full Golden Globes coverage to get the latest news on Hollywood’s big night.

“With the monologue, as far as talking about anything in the news right now, it seems like this year more than ever Hollywood has its own internal politics that obviously deserve to be talked about,” he said, referencing the headlines made by Harvey Weinstein and other major entertainment figures accused of sexual misconduct. “Going into it our focus is far more on the worlds that make these films and less on anything that’s happening in Washington.”

However, between show segments on Tuesday, Kotb told E! News that Lauer was among the slew of people congratulating her on the new position.

""He was sweet this morning. Certain texts popped up, and there was one from Matt: 'Congratulations!'"" said Kotb. ""And he said some nice words.""

The new host said that the text was not unwelcome.

""It meant the world to me to hear from him,"" Kotb said. ""It was really nice.""

Lauer was fired by NBC in November amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Since his termination, more reports have come up about additional alleged misconduct, some reportedly involving Today staffers and interns. Lauer has kept a low profile since the news broke, but released a statement in November.

-903214,Who Did Emily Maynard Pick: The Bachelorette Dumps Arie and Makes the Right Choice,"It is official! Emily Maynard and Jef Holm, the edgy, Mormon entrepreneur, are engaged to be married.

In a tearful season finale Sunday night, after meeting daughter Ricki for the first time, Jef got down on one knee and proposed to Emily, to which she hastily accepted. However, instead of rejecting the proposal of Arie Luyendyk Jr., the racecar driver, she respectfully let him go the day before, sparing him the embarrassment that many before have experienced on the show.

Interestingly, it was later revealed that after the show ended Arie traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, the hometown of Emily, because he didn’t feel their emotional breakup had enough closure. Although he didn’t see Emily, they talked on the phone, and he dropped off the diary he kept with him throughout the journey on her doorstep, urging her to read through it. However, Emily has not yet read the diary, and she revealed as much last night on the live portion of the show when she took out the diary which was still inside a sealed envelope.

Will Jef and Emily last? Only time will tell. But, I can tell you that they definitely have a better shot at working out than she would have had with Arie, whose fast-paced racecar driver lifestyle would be difficult to juggle with a family. Jef, on the other hand, is the much safer bet: not only does his job seem very flexible, but also he expressed his feelings to Emily whereas Arie demonstrated them physically and sexually. If she had chosen Arie, their relationship would most likely have suffered.

With another season of The Bachelorette in the record books, who will be the next man chosen to be on The Bachelor? My two bets would be Arie and Sean Lowe, the insurance agent who made it all the way to the final three in Curacao only to be let go. Rumors say it will be Sean, but don’t count Arie out.

Prior to DeGeneres’ test, Meyers revealed that he is somewhat nervous for Sunday night’s show, in particular being in front of some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. “At least some of them have been on my show … But you’d rather you didn’t recognize them,” Meyers joked. “I would rather look out into a room full of strangers, as opposed to movie stars.”

Noted sculptor Brad Pitt is famously single — and apparently fighting off gangs of thirsty women everywhere he goes. So it should come as no surprise that sometimes the baggy-pants aficionado chooses to go incognito with the ladies by using a different name. Or should we say, his real name.

As Wikipedia confirms, Brad Pitt was actually born William Bradley Pitt. And wouldn’t you know, according to “Page Six,” dear ol’ Brad recently introduced himself as William when chatting with a lady at Coffee Commissary in Los Angeles.

Pitt reportedly showed up on his motorcycle, wearing “sunglasses, jeans and a leather jacket” (how cool), and sparked up a conversation with a woman in line who “looked a little like Kate Bosworth, but it wasn’t her.” Per “Page Six”:

When the woman said, “I’m Lydia,” Pitt “put out his hand and said, ‘Hi, I’m William.’ She replied, ‘Oh, you look like a Bradley.’ And he responded, ‘Well, that’s my middle name’ and smiled and winked at her.”

As Lydia exited she said, “‘Nice to meet you, Bradley . . . I mean William.’ He laughed to himself, then got on his bike.”

""I just wasn’t happy with the way I looked, so I was trying to control the way the camera moved,"" Smith said. ""I got a bit obsessive. I was constantly looking in the mirror, pinching my waist, weighing myself every day.""

Gaga hit the stage following a fire-and-drum-filled opening spectacle from Kendrick Lamar to tone things down at the piano.

“This is for my father’s late sister Joanne,” Gaga said from her piano bench, before launching into her new version of the title track from her 2016 album Joanne. “This is for love and compassion, even when you can’t understand.”

She also performed “Million Reasons” at a lit-up white grand piano draped in massive angel wings, with Joanne producer Mark Ronson on guitar. Gaga showed off her powerful pipes on both songs, infusing emotion into every note.

-903662,So About That Grapefruit Oral Sex Scene in 'Girls Trip',"Google Girls Trip right now, and you'll see two major—and extremely different—results: First, and most importantly, are the headlines about the film's success at the box office and what that means for more films led by women of color in Hollywood (all good things, hopefully). The second? The Grapefruit Method, an oral sex technique demonstrated (hilariously) by Tiffany Haddish—without question the breakout star of Girls Trip.

The Grapefruit Method isn't a new term or something invented by the film–it was actually first popularized back in 2014 by viral tutorial videos from Auntie Angel of Angel's Erotic Solutions. (You can see that here.) But in a scene-stealing moment of the film, Haddish's character, Dina, demonstrates for her friends the oral sex act while using a grapefruit and a banana as props. Since then, the scene has launched many discussions about whether it's for real.

The directions, according to Dina, are simple: Cut off the top and bottom of a room-temperature grapefruit, then cut a hole in the middle of it. Place the grapefruit on your partner's member, and then...well, twist.

You can see a portion of it in the clip below:

""Grapefruiting is an act of love,"" Haddish explained to Entertainment Weekly in an interview. ""Make it mystical and magical."" It certainly had an effect on-set: Jada Pinkett Smith told EW that Haddish started receiving love letters from the crew after filming. ""That’s true,"" Haddish confirmed. ""Somebody bought me something from Jared jewelry. All the guys started coming to my comedy shows.""

And Auntie Angel herself thinks the movie got it right, with one exception: ""Use a condom,"" she told TooFab. ""There are chances that citrus can get into his urethra, and he can have a bad experience—and, of course, they proved that in the movie.""",real

The Goodies singer, who gave birth to her second child, her first with Russell, in April, showed off her incredible post-baby body in the images, which were taken in the pair’s bedroom.

In the shots, Ciara wore just a white shirt to protect her modesty, while also going make-up free and displaying her long braided hair. One frame saw the 32-year-old posing with the shirt unbuttoned to the waist to show a hint of her cleavage and enviably flat stomach, while the other showed the singer wearing the shirt back to front and holding it to her chest as she knelt on the bed.

Ciara shared the images on her Instagram page, tagging in American footballer Russell as the photographer.

-903813,Oscars: Gary Oldman Wins Best Actor for ‘Darkest Hour’,"Gary Oldman won the Academy Award for best actor on Sunday night.

The Darkest Hour star beat out Timothee Chalamet (Call Me by Your Name), Daniel Day-Lewis (Phantom Thread), Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out) and Denzel Washington (Roman J. Israel, Esq.).

The award capped off a season of other honors for Oldman at shows such as the Critics’ Choice, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA Awards. It was the first Oscar win for the actor. He was previously nominated for best actor for 2011’s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

In Darkest Hour, Oldman portrays revered U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the early days of World War II. The actor praised Churchill as he accepted his award, saying, “I would just like to salute Sir Winston Churchill, who has been marvelous company on what can be described as an incredible journey.”

Oldman concluded by thanking his mother, “who is older than the Oscar, she is 99 years young, next birthday. And she’s watching the ceremony from the comfort of her sofa. I say to my mother, ‘Thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on. I’m bringing an Oscar home.'”

Backstage, Oldman said that his Darkest Hour role held “special significance” for him. “I can’t say what it would be like to win an Oscar in any other year, but to win it for playing Winston makes it doubly special. It’s been an unforgettable experience.”

When asked what Churchill would say to today’s political leaders, Oldman replied: “He would probably give them a good talking to.”

The 23-time Grand Slam winner said on Snapchat she is “super close” to returning to her championship form five months after she gave birth to her first child.

Her post read in part:

“My coach and team always said ‘only go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the way’. I can compete – but I don’t want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time. With that being said, and even though I am disappointed about it, I’ve decided not to compete in the Australian Open this year.



“The memory of last year’s Open is one that I will carry with me, and Olympia and I look forward to coming back again. I appreciate the support and understanding of my fans and everyone at the Australian Open.”

The Australian Open begins Jan. 15. Williams’s victory last year was her seventh in Melbourne and her last Grand Slam victory before the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.

The Australian Open tweeted best wishes shortly after her announcement, saying in part: ""Good luck for the rest of 2018, Serena! We'll miss you""

Andy Murray pulled out of the event earlier Thursday, citing a hip injury. And Novak Djokovic, who has won in Melbourne six times, is undecided on whether he'll play.

We can’t remember there being too many in the past, but regardless of whether it was or not, Saoirse Ronan, nor her mother, Monica, will forget the 2018 Golden Globe Awards in a hurry.

Saoirse had been touted as a potential winner in the build-up to the ceremony and so it proved on Sunday night as she came away with the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy for her role as a high-school student in the coming-of-age movie Ladybird.

You can see the list of winners in full here.

As big a deal as the award is in itself, when you consider the competition she faced on the night – Emma Stone, Margot Robbie, Judi Dench and Helen Mirren – it really brings home the scale of the achievement.

Due to time constraints, Saoirse was limited in what she could say in her acceptance speech but she did give a shout out to her mother watching “on Facetime over there on someone’s phone right now” as well as some of the important women in her life, all her family and friends and everyone in the room at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.

There were so many moving speeches and powerful moments at the 75th annual Golden Globe Awards. Women were in full force tonight: Oprah gave an incredibly empowering speech and Natalie Portman called out the Globes for its all-male directing category…and Portman wasn’t the only person on stage who called the ceremony out. While presenting the last award of the evening for Best Picture, Drama (it went to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), Barbra Streisand gently — but powerfully — mentioned that she was the last woman to win Best Director at the Golden Globe Awards for the film Yentl.

She also mentioned that she won in 1984, which was 34 years ago. 34 years:

“Backstage I heard they said I was the only woman…to get the best director award, and you know, that was 1984: That was 34 years ago. Folks, time’s up! We need more women directors and more women to be nominated for best director. There are so many films out there that are so good directed by women.”





We all know that we have a long way to go in Hollywood (and everywhere) when it comes to gender equality.

Tonight was a powerful night for women in show business as the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements ruled the evening, but it should be noted that Greta Gerwig was snubbed for Best Director. Lady Bird is critically acclaimed and even won Best Picture, Comedy or Musical tonight — but Gerwig wasn’t recognized for it. What else does Gerwig have to do to be nominated?

What about all of the other incredible films that women have directed in the past 34 years?

Streisand is right. Time is up for the neglect and dismissal of women in film. Behind the scenes, in front of them, and all around them. Time is up for women not being appreciated.

It was incredible to have Streisand, such a living legend, call our attention to the amount of time that has passed since a woman won Best Director at the Golden Globes.

We hope women are nominated at the Oscars, and we hope that next year, there are many more women nominated at the Globes. We hope these Hollywood institutions start realizing why representation matters.",real

The nominees for best director include Bradley Cooper for A Star Is Born, Alfonso Cuaron for Roma, Peter Farrelly for Green Book, Spike Lee for BlacKkKlansman and Adam McKay for Vice.

During the 2018 ceremony, presenter Natalie Portman pointedly criticized the lack of female nominees during the televised show. Portman went off script and stated, “And here are all the male nominees.”

Barbara Streisand remains the only woman to ever win the best director prize. She was the first female director to be nominated and won in 1984 for Yentl. Streisand was again nominated in 1992 for The Prince of Tides.

Only four women have been nominated in the category following Streisand. In 1994, Jane Campion was nominated for The Piano, Sofia Coppola earned a nomination in 2004 for Lost in Translation, Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for The Hurt Locker and in 2013 for Zero Dark Thirty and Ava DuVernay in 2015 for Selma.

Similar to the Golden Globes, the Academy Awards have historically lacked representation of female directors in the nominations. Bigelow is the only woman to win the best director Oscar for The Hurt Locker, while Coppola, Campion and Lina Wertmuller are the only other women to be nominated in the category.

Meghan Markle has closed her social media accounts, Kensington Palace confirmed.

Markle, who spent Tuesday afternoon visiting a Brixton community radio station with fiance Prince Harry, shut down her Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts.

The palace said she was ""grateful to everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years"" but had closed them ""as she has not used these accounts for some time"".

Ann Widdicombe says Meghan Markle is 'trouble'

The decision to close her social media accounts is in line with her changing status, as she will soon become a member of the royal family when she marries Harry in May.

Senior members of the monarchy have official Twitter and Instagram accounts, run by the social media teams of their households, which do not normally feature personal tweets or posts.

The exception is the Duke of York who sometimes writes tweets himself but signs them ""AY"".

Markle will come under Kensington Palace after her wedding and social media postings will be made on her behalf by its communications staff.

“Maybe it suits you to play the victim,” Morgan told Harding. “But I think the victim in all this wasn’t you. It was Nancy Kerrigan, who had her Olympic dream shattered.”

After taking a moment to respond, Harding then threatened to end the interview. “Thank you so much. I appreciate being on your show, but I think I’m going to have to say, ‘Have a good night.'”

Taken aback by her decision to cut the interview short, Morgan continued to press, “You’re going to end the interview, because I think that Nancy Kerrigan was the victim here and not you?”

“You weren’t letting me finish,” Harding argued. “I think that many people are the victims of abuse every single day and can’t stand up for themselves. People need to be able to understand that we need to stand united and that abuse should not be happening anymore.”

Tension continued to grow as Morgan began pressing Harding about her involvement with Kerrigan’s attack. “You did know, didn’t you? You did know what was happening?” Morgan asked, with Harding responding, “No I did not know anything prior. … No knowledge.”

Morgan then abruptly ended the interview soon after.

Harding’s biopic was recently nominated for three Golden Globes including best picture, comedy or musical. Although hesitant to be involved with the film, Harding told The Hollywood Reporter that she found Robbie’s portrayal worthy. “I was so nervous to watch it, but when I saw it, I wasn’t watching a movie about me. I was watching Margot, and then I went, ‘Oh my goodness. That’s about me,'” Harding said.

More than 10 years after she first guest-starred on the original run of the hit NBC comedy, the multitalented star will appear on Thursday's episode in two separate roles: She'll play both herself and NYPD detective Harlee Santos, her character on NBC's ""Shades of Blue.""

Back in 2004, Lopez, 48, appeared as herself on several episodes of the show, even singing at Karen and Lyle’s Vegas wedding in the season 6 finale.

On Thursday's episode, Jack (Sean Hayes) nabs a small acting job — playing a corpse in a morgue! — on an episode of ""Shades of Blue.""

In the first preview clip, Jack tells Karen (Megan Mullally) how he plans to use his experience on set to reunite with his BFFF.

""Your Best Famous Friend Forever who hasn't spoken to you in 10 years, changed her email, phone number and address and returned the creepy fan art you painted?"" Karen asks.

""Yes, that's the one! Jenny from the Block Me on All Social Media!"" Jack says happily.

Billed as “a global celebration of unity and love,” ABC’s Olympics-themed The Bachelor: Winter Games will reportedly feature a Nancy Kerrigan appearance, “winter-themed challenges,” plenty of snow, and roses — but not too much booze.

According to a source who spoke with E! News, ABC enforced new alcohol-consumption guidelines on the upcoming Bachelor spinoff, such as forbidding contestants from drinking immediately before competing in any challenges. (Not a bad idea!) ABC also reportedly implemented a two-drink-per-hour rule, required contestants to log all their drinks, and brought on mental-health and wellness staff members.

The alcohol crackdown is likely a response to last summer’s Bachelor in Paradise sexual-misconduct scandal, in which Corinne Olympios accused fellow contestant DeMario Jackson of sexually assaulting her when she was too intoxicated to consent. According to a Bachelor in Paradise crew member, Olympios “seemed to go limp” during their sexual encounter in a hot tub. (Warner Bros. later claimed there was no wrongdoing.)

While the new guidelines won’t stop contestants from getting at least a little drunk — most people would be if they had four drinks in two hours, which the rules allow — E! News’s insider said, “The producers took this really seriously.”",real

""Amal and I wanted to thank you for a fantastic night of theatre,” the note to the cast reads. “We loved every minute of it. You were all so wonderful. My extended family (half of Beirut) loved it too. Thank you and have a great run. Love, George and Amal.”

The sweet gesture was very much appreciated.

""This is better than fairy dust!"" Bethan wrote. ""A letter and flowers from George and Amal Clooney!

On Dec. 27, Bethan revealed the A-list couple attended the show, calling them ""generous and humble.""

This isn't the first time George and Amal have been thoughtful of others. Last month, they gave all of their fellow passengers on a plane headphones to cancel any noise their newborn twins, Ella and Alexander, would make.

-905658,Oprah Facetimes With Ellen From California Mudslide Neighborhood,"Santa Barbara County’s Montecito community has been reeling following deadly mudslides from heavy rains upon a fire-ravaged landscape. At least 17 people died in the mudflows, and over 100 homes in Montecito were destroyed (some swept off foundations) in the neighborhood shared by Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. The two previously shared images from the catastrophe, and on Thursday, Ellen — who evacuated and has been unable to check on her house — FaceTimed with Oprah, who is still at her home, which (miraculously) only suffered minor damage while nearby houses were crushed.

Winfrey also brought some firefighters, who received an enormous round of applause, on camera while telling Ellen that she’s not fleeing Montecito because she wants to do whatever possible to help her community. She commented on how the sky looked red — “I didn’t know at the time that there were some gas fires, something exploded” — and then the mudslides began. It took awhile for reality to set in for Winfrey the next morning:

“I’m looking out the front window, I think everything’s fine, everything’s fine — and it wasn’t until I put my boots on walking and I realized everything … wasn’t fine at all. All of my neighbors’ homes are gutted … The neighbors out back, their houses are gone.”

Oprah continued, commenting upon how she shares a fence with Ellen and how several nearby homes are simply “gutted.” Fortunately for Winfrey, her house is located on a knoll, so she feels safe for now, even though her home won’t have water or gas service until further notice.

In the below clip, Ellen uses her monologue to explain how much she loves Montecito. The host grows quite upset while revealing how she and wife Portia DeRossi had returned on December 27 from fire evacuations, only to be ordered to evacuate again on Sunday. “This room is always filled with positivity and love and today I really need it,” she began. “Today I need you because there’s a lot going on in my life right now.”

I was with him during the whole leukemia thing and he doesn’t even care about me,” he tells KoKo. That’s when she shuts him down!

“It’s not just about a hot body. My show is about mind, body and soul and really changing people from within and realizing that there’s so much more to life than just an exterior,” she tells Joel.

When Khloe asks him what really motivates him, he breaks down — except she isn’t buying it! “You don’t have to fake cry just cause I said that. The tear was perfectly acting,” she responds. Yowza!

Rumors are going around that Insecure star and HBO writer Issa Rae turned Drake down at the Golden Globes after party.

Hot New Hip Hop reports that Rae spoke out on the matter but didn’t give a specific answer to the question. Some background information to know about Rae is that she is a huge Drake fan.

She’s so much of a fan that she puts the rapper’s lyrics into every episode of Insecure as sort of an easter egg for fans to listen for. She told Hot New Hip Hop doing, “that was a personal thing for me, but that’s not something that we bang you over the head with.”

Supposedly at the after party, E! News reports that Drake made his entourage stop when he passed by Rae. He then asked if she wanted to go with him to a Netflix party.

Sources say she declined the invite because she was with her friends and the walked away. Another source says that it didn’t happen that way. Instead, they say the two were very cordial with each other and, “exchanged pleasantries” and that she “never denied” Drake.

That source also said that the two didn’t know each other very well anyway. E! News tweeted that Rae turned down Drake which caused her to speak up about the exchange. She doesn’t come out saying that she turned Drake down, however she tweets a headline with the E! News article attached saying, “Obsessed Fan Who Dedicated Entire Season To Artist Continues to Shamelessly Fangirl When She Sees Him at Party Later.”

Instead of turning him down, she fangirled about the whole meeting. The same night, Drake DJ’ed at another party to which Rae loved. In a video, she could be heard calling Drake “zaddy” and complimenting Drake saying the playlist he used was, “simply correct” and that he’s a, “phenomenal DJ.”

But after Khloe instilled enough faith back into Mayank and he lost 44 pounds, he decided to be true to himself and parents. At the end of the show, Mayank decides to break the news and finally open up about his sexuality.





Though nerve racking, his father took a dramatic pause and finally said, "" you're my child and your happiness is my happiness so I accept you for what you are and I want to see you happy.""





It was an emotional moment for the family as Mayank had tears in his eyes his mother added, ""I'm happy for you. You're my baby. I love you. We're very proud of you.""

When Natalie Portman introduced the Best Director candidates at the Golden Globes as the “all-male nominees,” it inspired a bit of controversy. Onscreen, it appeared as if the directors — Martin McDonagh, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, and Guillermo del Toro — might have been a bit miffed. However, you can at least consider the smiling eye roll that del Toro gave to the camera to be a sheepish reaction instead of an offended one. The Shape of Water filmmaker and Globe recipient for Best Director told IndieWire that he approves of Portman’s comment, “I think it was great! She should say exactly what she feels. There is phenomenal work being done by female directors.” He then cited three films that were helmed by women directors in 2017 that could have also received award nods. “Mudbound, Lady Bird, and Wonder Woman are all terrific,” he said.

If this year’s Oscars are anything like the Golden Globes, hopefully del Toro will pass on the memo to his rivals. For what it’s worth, Spielberg doesn’t believe women will be shut out of the upcoming Academy Awards Oscars.",real

Sony Television announced Wednesday that Janelle Monae and Juno Temple have joined the cast of “Philip K. Dick’s Electric Dreams,” a 10-episode sci-fi anthology series that will adapt a number of the renowned author’s short stories.

Both actresses will star in the “Autofac” episode, which features a world where human civilization is in shambles. Despite society and the world as we know it having collapsed, a massive, automatic product-manufacturing factory continues to operate according to the principles of consumerism — humans consume products to be happy, and in order to consume continuously, they must be denied freedom of choice and free will. When a small band of rebels decide to shut down the factory, they discover they may actually be the perfect consumers after all.

Monae, who recently starred in “Hidden Figures” and “Moonlight,” will play Alexis, an Autofac representative. Temple, who recently appeared on “Vinyl,” will play Emily, one of the rebels.

Sony also announced that Jay Paulson (“Mad Men”) and David Lyons (“Revolution”) will appear in the episode, but didn’t disclose their parts.

Travis Beacham, co-writer of “Pacific Rim,” will write the episode and Peter Horton (“Grey’s Anatomy”) will direct.

The series has cast a number of big-name actors for its other installments, including Steve Buscemi, Greg Kinnear, Anna Paquin, Terrence Howard, Richard Madde and Vera Farmiga. Bryan Cranston, who is an executive producer on the series, also stars.

Other writers signed on include Ronald D. Moore (“Battlestar Galactica”), Michael Dinner (“Justified”), Tony Grisoni (“Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas”), Jack Thorne (“National Treasure”), Matthew Graham (“Life on Mars”), David Farr (“The Night Manager”) and Dee Rees (“Mudbound”).

“Electric Dreams” will air later this year in the U.K. on Channel 4 before being available on Amazon Prime.

Both actors had agreed to return to set after Kevin Spacey was fired from the movie and replaced by Christopher Plummer after Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct by actor Anthony Rapp and others. But it was reported by CNBC that ""Michelle Williams was paid an $80 per diem totaling less than $1,000"" while Wahlberg was paid $1.5 million. Williams never publicly confirmed her fee, but has spoken out about Wahlberg's donation.

""Today isn’t about me. My fellow actresses stood by me and stood up for me, my activist friends taught me to use my voice, and the most powerful men in charge, they listened and they acted. If we truly envision an equal world, it takes equal effort and sacrifice,"" Williams said in a statement to ELLE.com. ""Today is one of the most indelible days of my life because of Mark Wahlberg, WME and a community of women and men who share in this accomplishment. Anthony Rapp, for all the shoulders you stood on, now we stand on yours.""

WME, the agency that represents Wahlberg, Williams, and the movie's director Ridley Scott, agreed to pledge an additional $500,000 to Time's Up.

Molzahn continued, “Taylor, you’re the answer to some of my hearts greatest prayers and deepest desires, and that you have chosen me, and that we really get to do this, my heart is full of praise! God’s Love and faithfulness has always been true to me, but since the day I met you, I truly believed that God had all along been letting me find my way to you.”

And she returns to international competition at the World Championships in Qatar this month.

""I think it was very important to support the fellow gymnasts it had happened to and to speak up for what you believe in and say 'I don't think this is right' and I hope I gave them courage to come out and tell their stories one day if they want to,"" she said.

-906443,"Princess Charlotte is the boss at home, the queen reveals","Four-year-old Prince George may be ahead of his little sister Princess Charlotte in line for the throne, but she’s clearly the ruler at home.

That's according to their great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, who noted the power balance between the young royal siblings during a meeting on Sunday at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. The queen was presenting a Bible she signed to a 10-year-old student who won a contest for the best religious studies project at her school when the funny exchange took place.

The 91-year-old monarch asked the student if she “looked after” her younger sister. The girl’s mom jumped in saying: “It’s the other way around,"" according to the Daily Mail.

The queen replied, “It’s like that with Charlotte and George,” noting how the 2-year-old princess keeps a watchful eye over her older brother, the prince.

According to the father of the lucky student, who won the same prize as his daughter in 1990, Charlotte's inclination to watch over her older brother is typical sibling behavior.

""It is often the case that a younger child is more confident,"" he said at the event. ""It is second child syndrome.""

This shouldn’t be a complete shocker for royal family fans. Last year, the Duchess of Cambridge reportedly told a fellow mom that her daughter Charlotte was “the one in charge” at home.

And last fall, Prince William The Duke of Cambridge, her father, joked that his daughter is “going to be trouble when she gets older.”

The accuser, actress Tracey Birdsall alleged to TMZ that in 2016, she was returning a salad spinner to Seal, when she claimed he attempted to force himself on her and groped her breasts.

At the time, a rep for Seal told ET, ""Seal vehemently denies the recent accusations made against him by a former neighbor for alleged misconduct of more than a year ago. He intends to vigorously defend himself against these false allegations.""

Just days before the allegations came to light, Seal caused some controversy on social media, calling out Hollywood hypocrisy with a past photo of Oprah Winfrey kissing Harvey Weinstein on the cheek, before later clarifying that he has ""enormous respect"" for her.

-906664,Jimmy Kimmel Reveals Why His Twitter Feud With Kanye West Made Him 'So Happy',"Jimmy Kimmel loves to joke around, even if it gets him in trouble.

In an interview from his February 2018 GQ cover story posted earlier this week, the 50-year-old late night host opened up about the infamous 2013 Twitter feud with Kanye West.

“I live for moments like that. When I got in a Twitter battle with Kanye, I was so happy,"" Kimmel told the mag. ""My wife makes fun of me. She's like, ‘You are so happy right now.’ I'm absolutely beaming. I feel very confident in a situation like that.""

The online war began when Kimmel did a parody sketch on his show, making fun of the rapper's BBC interview in which he claimed he was the ""biggest"" rock star. West didn't appreciate the joke and exploded on Twitter, calling out Kimmel.

""JIMMY KIMMEL IS OUT OF LINE TO TRY AND SPOOF IN ANY WAY THE FIRST PIECE OF HONEST MEDIA IN YEARS,"" West tweeted at the time, followed by more NSFW comments.

The feud was eventually squashed when West made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! this past October. Then for Kimmel's 50th birthday, Kim Kardashian West read one of her husband's infamous tweets during the show's ""Mean Tweets"" segment.

“JIMMY KIMMEL PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES… OH NO THAT MEANS YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TOO MUCH GOOD P**Y IN YOUR LIFE,” she read aloud.

Meanwhile, Kimmel is gearing up to host the Oscars for a second year in a row. Hollywood has already been very vocal about the recent sexual harassment and misconduct allegations within the industry, and Kimmel is ready to tackle the subject during awards night.

“I'm surprisingly not nervous,” he said. “I think there are certain groups of people who think I shouldn't make any jokes about that situation. And there are groups of people who will be mad if I don't make jokes about that situation. So you just kind of have to figure it out. Whatever I do will be criticized by someone. Like, ‘You didn't make enough jokes about Harvey Weinstein.'""

“We are great and there’s so much friendship and love, and we surround Jack with love, and funny, kind, happy people, and as a result, he is really happy.”

Faris told E! News that they “try to discipline when he’s being a little naughty,” but added, “I think the key is surrounding him with a lot of joy and happiness, which he has a ton of.”

She continued, telling the outlet, “I think it’s those small moments in life, when your kid says something funny or, like for me, I love what I do so I get a kick out of feeling like I nailed a joke well.”

The actress wouldn’t reveal details on her relationship status to Extra but did say she was “really lucky that I am surrounded by love, people that I love, and I feel so fortunate to have amazing friends, amazing family.”

Faris has sparked rumours of dating again when she was seen on several dates with cinematographer Michael Barrett, 47, in October 2017.

“Anna has been hanging out with Michael for weeks,” a source told PEOPLE at the time. “They were hanging out occasionally in September, but started seeing each other more frequently recently.”

Faris opened up about her separation from Pratt to PEOPLE in October, saying, “We’ll always have each other and be incredible friends.”

“There is still so much laughter in our lives together, and he is so proud of me, still,” she added at the time. “We watched each other grow, and he still cracks me up all the time. And I think I crack him up — unless he’s a really good actor and great at faking laughter.”

“There was no other way than to be preemptive in a story that had to be watched. He did a statement. I think it’s very clear the way that he stands,” Zeta-Jones said. “I cannot elaborate on something that’s so very personal to him.”

Zeta-Jones made it clear she supports both her husband’s denial and the #MeToo anti-harassment movement at large: “My reaction was that as two people who have been in this business — him longer than me — was that we support ‘Me Too’ and the movement more than anybody, anybody — me as a woman, him as a man.”

In an interview with Deadline published January 10, Douglas noted that a sexual harassment claim was going to be made against him in the future. The actor said he received a message from his attorney that The Hollywood Reporter was interested in a story involving one of the actor’s former employees who alleges he sexually harassed her approximately 32 years ago. The woman alleges Douglas “spoke raunchily” to her and to his friends when she was around. She also claims Douglas masturbated in front of her.

“I had the choice of waiting for a story to come out, one that will clearly get picked up by other newspapers and magazines, and then I have to sit there and try to defend myself. Or, try to share with the public, a little ahead of the story, my thoughts and concerns,” Douglas said about his decision to come forward before the allegations were made publicly.

Douglas apologized to the woman if he used “coarse language” in front of her, but he denied ever masturbating in front of her. The actor said this accusation is a “complete lie” and that there is “no truth to it whatsoever.” He also expressed concerns over the fact that an allegation could harm the future of his career.",real

-906981,Zac Efron As Serial Killer Ted Bundy: A First Look,"When one briefly considers actors who’d be effective at playing a serial killer, Zac Efron does not immediately come to mind. Instead, Joaquin Phoenix has been throwing some serious John Wayne Gacy vibes during some of Joker origin story director Todd Phillips’ reveals for that film. However, Phoenix is a busy guy, and more importantly, serial killers don’t always arrive in the same homogeneous package. So, it turns out that there’s room for Efron in the lineup, especially given that Ted Bundy, who killed dozens of victims, was widely regarded as a charismatic fellow with magnetic good looks and a winning personality, who could have been mistaken for a Kennedy prior to his arrest.

To that effect, the Sundance Institute has unveiled its upcoming festival lineup, which shall include the Joe Berlinger-directed Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil And Vile with Efron in the Bundy role. Here’s a first official look:

The film will aim to tell the Bundy story from the perspective of his longtime girlfriend, Elizabeth Kloepfer (played by Lily Collins), who suspected for over a year that he may have been a killer. Earlier this year, Efron Instagrammed a few unofficial images from the set of the film, including a from-behind shot of Ted and Liz’s first meeting and a picture of Ted in his car, presumably during a late-night hunt.

The full Sundance lineup gets a more thorough detailing here but will also include Mindy Kaling’s writing and starring turn in Late Night, about a late-night talk show host (a woman played by Emma Thompson) who employs her very first female writer. Leonard Cohen, Harvey Weinstein, Toni Morrison, and Mils Davis biopics are also in the mix, along with a film about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s rise to Congress. The festival begins on January 24.

Prince William has previously poked fun at his receding hairline, telling hairstylist Taz Kabria: ""I don't have much hair, I can't give you much business,"" during a visit to a café with a hairdresser's salon next door. His dad, Prince Charles, also joked about William's hair during William and Kate's wedding breakfast.

-907035,18 Times Celebrities Got Real About Red-Carpet Fashion,"Sure, we all love the glitz and glamour of red-carpet appearances, but these things are never as easy as they seem. In fact, several actresses have been candid over the years about challenges that go into awards-show season—namely, finding a designer who works outside of limited sample sizes, which are typically 0 through 4.

Most recently, Bebe Rexha shared that she's having trouble finding designers to dress her for the 2019 Grammy Awards. (She's nominated for Best New Artist and Best Country Duo/Group Performance.) ""I had my team hit out a lot of designers and a lot of them do not want to dress me because I’m too big,” she said in an Instagram video, clarifying that she's a size 8.

In December, Megan Mullally took to Instagram to share that she couldn't find a designer to dress her for the Screen Actor’s Guild Awards in January—even though she was going to be hosting the entire thing. “Looks like I will be buying my dress online though, as per my usual, even though there is literally a 100 percent chance that I will be on camera, because I’M HOSTING IT,” she wrote in an Instagram post in December. “Designers do not send me dresses.”

A Wrinkle in Time director Ava DuVernay also spoke out about not finding designers to dress her in a tweet on December 23. ""I’m a director, not an actress. Not a Size 0. I like to stay covered. Stylists weren’t inspired,"" she tweeted.

They're not alone: Stars like Leslie Jones, Tiffany Haddish, and Rachel Bloom have found themselves in the same boat and have had to purchase their own red-carpet gowns (we're talking $$$, of course) to put together their looks.

Iconic French sex symbol Brigitte Bardot made it clear she does not back the #MeToo movement in a new interview with Paris Match, a French magazine akin to People.

""Regarding actresses — not women in general — the vast majority of cases are hypocritical, ridiculous and without interest,"" Bardot, 83, said in an article translated by USA TODAY.

She added, ""It takes away from important themes that need to be discussed. Me, I was never the victim of sexual harassment. And I always found it charming when someone told me I was beautiful or I had a cute (butt). This kind of compliment is nice.""

Bardot believes,""There are a lot of actresses who tease producers in order to get roles. Then later they say they were harassed. In reality, this harms them more than it helps.""

Earlier this month, fellow French film icon Catherine Deneuve, 74, apologized publicly after she joined 99 other prominent female writers, entertainers, historians, journalists, curators, academics and intellectuals in signing an open letter in Parisian newspaper Le Monde likening the #MeToo movement to a ""witch hunt.""

The piece argued, ""This urge to send men to the slaughterhouse instead of helping women be more autonomous helps the enemies of sexual freedom.""

-907163,Savannah Guthrie talks Hoda Kotb replacing Matt Lauer: 'Something really lovely and positive has happened',"Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb are turning a tough situation into a great experience! The pair officially became co-anchors of the Today show earlier this month when Kotb replaced Matt Lauer after the longtime anchor was fired late last year.

It marks the first time in the morning show’s history that there have been two female anchors.

“Savannah and I started anchoring together, and it was just weird,” Kotb recalled on Wednesday’s Tonight Show. “It was like if you’ve ever met a friend and had, like, a great moment where you say to yourself, ‘Wow, that was so much fun. It worked.’ I think we had an instant thing”

Guthrie agreed, joking, “Hoda said it was like a first date, and I was like, ‘and I’m easy and desperate,’ so no problem! It just clicked, and it felt so good. And we’re so happy.”

See photos of Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie together:



The duo also touched on Lauer’s sudden exit after 20 years on the show. Kotb admitted, “It was a difficult time for the show, no question.”

“Yeah, it was hard, and like everyone saw, we went through it,” Guthrie added. “But something really lovely and positive has happened. And I think that’s where we’re focused.”

And now the ladies are teaming up for the Winter Olympics in China next month. Kotb, who recently had a life-changing moment herself thanks to her new position, remarked on how special the event can be.

“The thing about the Olympics is there’s no other place on earth where you can sit there and watch a kid you’ve never heard of before and in that instant you get to watch their life change,” she said.

Anika Noni Rose opened up to SiriusXM about being sexually assaulted on plane last year.

“I have never spoken of this, but I will say this out loud now: I was assaulted on a plane last year. And I haven’t been able to get this person’s name; they won’t give me the name of the person.”

According to reports, the Tony winner said the incident happened without warning and that she didn’t even know the person.

There was no, ‘Hi, how are you doing?’ And I was asleep before the plane even took off; I’m one of those sleepers. I wanted to punch that man, and I knew that that would take away from the story that I had to tell. I had to hold in everything that I was feeling to be able to tell this story and be heard and taken seriously from the place I was in. It’s been…interesting.”

And while the man was removed from the plane, Anika hasn’t been given her perpetrator’s name

“There’s a Freedom of Information act. You’re supposed to be able to get people’s names. I made a report right then with the FBI and they dropped it. They dropped the case,” she said.

The actress has since taken to social media to share a gratitude of thanks after bravely sharing her story.

Gymnast McKayla Maroney said Larry Nassar’s abuse – or as he called it, “treatment” – began when she was 13 or 14 years old.

It continued through her gold medal-winning performance at the 2012 Olympics in London, and didn’t stop until she left the sport completely.

“As it turns out, much to my demise, Dr. Nassar was not a doctor, he in fact is, was, and forever shall be, a child molester, and a monster of a human being. End of story!” she wrote in a victim impact statement that was read aloud in court on Thursday as part of Nassar’s sentencing on charges of criminal sexual conduct.

“He abused my trust, he abused my body and he left scars on my psyche that may never go away,” Maroney wrote.

Maroney, now 22, is one of several prominent USA Gymnastics stars who have said Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor, sexually assaulted and abused athletes under the guise of providing medical treatment.

The letter read in court was identical to the victim impact statement Maroney wrote for Nassar’s federal court case on charges of child pornography. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison in that case.

-907427,Michael Douglas Accuser Speaks Out: ‘People Were Frightened for Me’ (Video),"Susan Braudy, the journalist and author accusing Michael Douglas of sexual misconduct, gave her first televised interview on Friday. “He thought he was the king of the world and that he could humiliate me without any repercussions,” she told “Today.”

Braudy said Douglas’ inappropriate behavior towards her occurred 30 years ago when she was employed by the actor.

“He slid down to the floor, unbuckled his belt, and put his hands inside his trousers. And I could see what he was doing,” she said. “And then he began to sort of fondle himself, and I was very scared.”

Braudy said that she had shared details of the incident with friends when it occurred, though she was advised by one not to say anything. “People were frightened for me,” she said.

On Thursday, The Hollywood Reporter published a story detailing Braudy’s accusations against Douglas, who preemptively denied her claims in an interview with Deadline last week, though he did reveal Braudy’s identity at the time.

Braudy told THR that while she was working for Douglas, he made demeaning comments about her appearance, used inappropriate sexual language when speaking to her and masturbated in front of her.

Douglas gave a statement to THR that include his assertion that “at no time then did she express or display even the slightest feeling of discomfort working in our environment, or with me personally. That is because at no time, and under no circumstance, did I behave inappropriately toward her.”

In his interview with Deadline, Douglas said: “I can’t believe that someone would cause someone else pain like this. Maybe she is disgruntled, her career didn’t go the way she hoped, and she is holding this grudge. It has caused tremendous stress to me for something I believe I have nothing to regret or feel responsible for.”

Representatives for Douglas did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.

Long before Tom Hardy became one of Hollywood’s brightest names he had dreams of being an MC. He even crafted a full length project that has been recently uncovered.

Back in 1999 he was known as Tommy No. 1 and actually had a record deal in place. Crafted with DJ / producer Eddie Too Tall AKA Ed Tracy (award winning television writer), Falling On Your Arse In 1999 was 18 tracks deep and featured a wide range of topics from the mind of Hardy.

According to an interview BBC conducted with Hardy in 2011, The Revenant actor picked up the microphone around 14 or 15 and has influential music executives backing him. “I used to be with the guy who managed Leela James and Lauren Hill, Pras, the Fugees and all that.

During his recent appearance at the Graham Norton Show, the 35-year-old actor revealed that he went through great lengths to impress girls in order to “get lucky”. Just like many others, Dornan too had a typical awkward teenager story. Although one might say, his embarrassing story is more R-rated than romantic.

In “one of the worst stories in my locker”, Dornan recalled, “I was quite small and wasn’t hairy at all – I was 15 and looked seven. On one particular day, I was in an amateur drama play and was going to a party after. For my role, I had bits of a black wig glued to my face for a beard and I decided to keep it for the party so I would look older. I also decided to cut up the rest of wig and glue it to my private parts just in case I got lucky“.

That reckless move backfired on the young Brit when it came time to remove the improvised pubic hair. “I didn’t get lucky and removing the bits of wig ripped out the very small amount of natural hair I had down there. It was a physically and emotionally painful experience!”

During the interview, the handsome star also shared about the “awful” scene to shoot in “Fifty Shades Freed“. In the movie trailer, we see the shirtless Christian Grey in blue shorts walking out of the beach in France. “That was horrendous. If they just tilt the camera down, that whole moment was awful,” Dornan told the host.

“We had the beach, semi-sort of closed off, but actually there were loads of people that we didn’t have control over.They want me to be sexy coming out of the water. But it’s not a sand beach! It’s one of those wee pebble beaches. Literally, you cannot look cool running out of the water,” he added.

In 2016, a woman named Christina Elizabeth Bankston was accused of cyberstalking the 62-year-old reality star and hacking her iCloud account two years earlier, where she allegedly sent threatening messages to her, her former spouse Caitlyn Jenner, two unnamed family members and two assistants.

Bankston’s public defenders have now filed a motion to have eight of the 15 counts against her dismissed, and according to E! News, the motion includes fresh accusations against Bankson, alleging that also in 2014, she obtained the username, password and security answers for Kris’ daughter Kourtney's AOL account and gained access to her emails.

It is unknown at the time of writing if Kourtney, 38, is one of the two unnamed family members from the 2016 filing, or if the accusations are completely new.

Bankston’s motion filing comes as her defence says she has the right to be prosecuted where the alleged crimes took place, rather than in California, where the ‘Keeping Up with the Kardashians’ stars live.

The documents state: ""The Constitution and the federal rules of criminal procedure protect [Bankston’s] right to be prosecuted in the federal judicial district where the alleged crimes occurred, rather than in a district convenient to the government or its celebrity complaining witnesses.”",real

The actress is scheduled to take the stage on Sunday night as the first presenter of the SAG Awards in the 23-year history of the ceremony. So, how did the special concert come about? Well, a phone call to start.

""They just called and said: 'Would you like to?' And at first I was nervous to say yes, but that quickly turned into flattery, to which I am susceptible, so I just said: ""Yes, absolutely"" and it seems very touching that it was also being a woman "". she told E! Sibley Scoles .",real

As for Mom herself, she couldn't have been more proud.

While Cindy couldn't applaud her son from the front row — for one, she was holding her phone — she made sure to give him a shout-out on Instagram to her 2.8 million followers.

The video included an applause emoji in the caption.

For Cindy, the not-so-typical family fun continued. After the show, the modeling icon, her son and her daughter, 16-year-old Kaia Gerber, who's also in fashion, hit the town.

The Crawford-Gerber crew, all dressed in some form of chic black, posed for a photo while out to dinner. How they all manage to look so ethereally beautiful in dim restaurant lighting is another question. But hey ... they're models, after all.

Crawford, 51, has been supportive of her children's fashion careers. They've even worked together! Last year, Kaia appeared in the same Versace show as her mother. And Presley helped re-create Cindy's iconic Pepsi ad, which will air during Super Bowl 52.

It's only sensible. With genes like that, it would be a shame to waste them!

Congratulations on a fabulous show, Presley! Mom, you taught him well.",real

-907957,Morgan Freeman wore a baseball hat to the 2018 SAG Awards,"There was a lot to talk about at the 2018 SAG Awards — Kristen Bell’s amazing opener, the well-deserved wins for This Is Us and Sterling K. Brown, and the hat Morgan Freeman decided to wear throughout the entire ceremony. While we appreciate the fact that the 80-year-old legend felt comfortable wearing a baseball hat indoors, we still have a few questions.

Freeman accepted the Life Achievement Award and his friend Rita Moreno — who presented the big honor — was quick to point out that he accepted it while sporting the baseball cap. “Lift up your hat,” she said, making the moment more notable. “There we go. Now we can see you,” she quipped. Freeman joked about the moment, saying, “You see what I had to put up with?”

While the actor didn’t reveal why he was wearing the cap, we have a few solid theories. For one, he might have just liked it (which is valid). There’s also a possibility that he was paying tribute to the Time’s Up movement — since the hat was black. Morgan noted that the SAG Awards still aren’t gender neutral and called for change in his acceptance speech, which adds some weight to the theory.

At the end of the day, we likely won’t ever know what inspired the look, but we do know people loved it.

-907910,Mandy Moore SAG Awards Look Inspired by a Dress from 2004,"Mandy Moore's serene blue sequin gown from yesterday's Screen Actors Guild Awards is so much more than a pretty dress. Turns out the Ralph Lauren Collection look actually represents a full circle version of the This Is Us star's career resurgence (maybe like Winona Ryder's comeback hair?).

Moore's stylist Erica Cloud explained it all to People, noting that the fashion house recreated the same Ralph Lauren dress Moore wore to LA premier of Saved in 2004 when she was just 20 years old. Moore even tried on the original dress, just to get the perfect fit.

“I think it’s very symbolic of her rebirth,” Cloud said about the whole design process. “It was such a cool look then, we thought, ‘Why not revisit it now?’ It’s a beautiful, elegant silhouette. For her, I think it shows she’s still herself, but just an updated version.""

Here's the original gown. See the resemblance?

Maybe the biggest update is Moore's very 2017 beauty look. She turned to very hip LA sisters and beauty gurus Ashley Streicher and Jenn Streicher for her hair and makeup yesterday.

Mandy's nude pout involved a layer of Laura Mercier Lip Pencil in Chestnut, with Laura Mercier Velour Extreme Matte Lipstick in Vibe applied on top. Her smoky copper eye involved a wash of Laura Mercier Caviar Stick Eye Colour in Copper up to the crease of her eyelid, with Laura Mercier Caviar Stick Eye Colour in Peacock as a pop of blue color in the corner of her eyes. On her nails, she wore Essie's Mademoiselle nail polish.

To get those bouncy curls, Ashley wrapped Moore's blow-dried hair in 1.25-inch velcro rollers and sprayed it with Garnier Fructis Style Full Control Anti-Humidity Aerosol Hairspray. After 20 minutes, Ashley took out the rollers, brushed out the curls with a boar bristle brush and hit it again with the hairspray. She brushed back one side and pinned it behind Moore's ear, then finished the look with Garnier Fructis Style Texture Tease Dry Touch Finishing Spray.

So classic Hollywood! She could — and should — keep re-doing this look every decade.",real

-907980,William H. Macy backstage at the SAG Awards: 'It's hard to be a man these days',"Backstage at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Shameless best-actor winner William H. Macy was asked if he had any advice for younger men on how to act around women in Hollywood.

His response, made earnestly, was ponderous, weighing the creative risks of creating a politically correct environment in the arts, gender parity (""it's inevitable"" he said firmly) and how men feel like ""we're under attack"" in the #MeToo era.

It was a puzzling mix.

On what he would tell younger men in his industry: ""That's a really complicated question because on one hand, with what we do for the living, we've got to be free to speak the unspeakable and try things. So I hope it doesn't throw a wet blanket on things. And I don't believe it will because half the business is women and they're smart,"" said Macy.

SAG Awards 2018:Time's Up quotes overheard on the red carpet

The actor noted he has two daughters (with wife Felicity Huffman). ""And I'm thrilled for them. It's a good time to be a girl. I'm proud of this business, because such things as safety in the workplace — that's done, we're not going back. It changed in an instant and it's not going back. When it comes to equality in pay, it's inevitable, and it's going to happen quickly.""

Macy then focused on how men are grappling with the #MeToo era.

""It's hard to be a man these days,"" said Macy. ""I think a lot of us feel like we're under attack and feel like we need to apologize. Perhaps we do. Perhaps we are. But we'll keep talking.""

Macy added that he had recently convened with other men to discuss aspects of Time's Up, the anti-harassment initiative started earlier this month by some of Hollywood's leading women.

""We had a meeting, a bunch of guys got together under the auspices of Time's Up. And that's good for men. Men don't talk enough, and they don't talk to other men. And we talked.""",real

Kensington Palace shared a picture of the mother-of-two discussing health issues and tweeted:

The palace went onto explain that at least 20 per cent of women are affected by mental health problems during pregnancy or in the first year following the birth of a child.

The Duchess - who was the brainchild of mental health campaign Heads Together with her husband Prince William and brother-in-law Prince Harry - has spoken openly about her own struggles with the isolation of motherhood following the birth of her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

Speaking with mothers during a meeting at the Global Academy earlier this year, the pregnant mum admitted to a group of mothers: 'It is lonely at times and you do feel quite isolated, but actually so many other mothers are going through exactly what you are going through.

'It is being brave enough, like you obviously were, to reach out to those around you.'

The palace also announced that Kate will visit the Hornsey Road Children's Centre in London on 14 November after having to postpone her engagement there in September following her battle with severe morning sickness.

During her visit, she will learn more about Family Action's perinatal mental health services and meet parents who have been helped by the charity, reports HELLO! Magazine.

Despite being pregnant, the Duchess shows no signs of reducing her royal duties, as she's scheduled to attend a gala dinner for the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families at Kensington Palace next week. The following day, she will also carry out an engagement with children's mental health charity Place2Be.

The talk show host and former police officer confessed that he was under the influence of alcohol when he flipped his car and was not reaching for his glasses, as previously stated.

According to TMZ, police in Darien, Conn., have charged Wilkos, 53, with DUI in the single car crash that sent him to the hospital and put his self-titled TV show on a brief break while he recovered.

TMZ recently learned that Wilkos' blood alcohol level was .29 percent after cops working on his investigation obtained his medical records via search warrant.

The talk show star turned himself in on Wednesday evening in Connecticut following a warrant that was issued for his arrest, but he was released after posting a $1,500 bond. Wilkos has been charged with operating a vehicle under the influence and failure to correctly drive.

As previously reported, Wilkos initially told the press that he usually wears glasses when he drives, but wasn’t wearing them at the time of the accident. He went as far as to claim that he was reaching for his spectacles when his car hit several roadside objects before flipping on its passenger side.

""Over the course of my life, I have been struggling with bouts of depression and on the day of my accident, I had a complete lapse in judgment which resulted in me drinking and getting behind the wheel of my car. I am lucky and so grateful that no one else was involved in the accident and truly humbled by the outpouring of love and support. This experience reinforces my commitment to get the professional help that I need and I have recently completed an intensive medically supervised program,"" Wilkos told Fox News in an email statement. ""I have built a career on a commitment to help others with their personal struggles and now I am faced with my own. Opening up my personal life to this level has been extremely difficult for my family and me, and I ask for your support in respecting our privacy so that we can all heal and move forward.

The nominees for the upcoming 2018 Oscars were just recently revealed last Tuesday and James Franco's name was definitely not on the list. But even with his failure to secure an Oscar nomination for his work on ""The Disaster Artist,"" which previously earned him awards from the Golden Globes and the SAG Awards, a source says that the 39-year-old actor is more concerned about the snub being correlated to the sexual harassment allegations he has been facing recently.

Furthermore, it has been reported that his close friends have been really worried about the actor, with one revealing how hurt Franco is.

""I am shocked and absolutely devastated by the loss of my incredible, caring friend,"" Taylor's storm-chasing partner and pal Reed Timmer wrote. ""We chased so many intense storms, and I wish we could have just one more storm chase. I'll miss you forever, Joel. We lost a legend.""

In addition to Storm Chasers, Taylor and Timmer also costarred in the 2003 documentary Tornado Glory and the TVNweather.com series Tornado Chasers. Taylor hailed from Oklahoma (part of Tornado Alley, where all three were filmed), specifically the town of Elk City.

""Our community of Elk City and the Storm Chasing community lost a great guy today,"" a local Facebook page, Team Western OK Chaser, wrote. ""Joel Taylor was truly an inspiration to myself and many who knew him. He was one of the most level headed chasers on the roads and truly a classy guy outside of chasing. He didn't chase for the glory he chased because he had a true passion for storms.""

Another friend, filmmaker, photographer, and storm chaser Mike Olbinski recalled Taylor's ""huge smile.""

""I'm heartbroken to hear of the passing of Joel Taylor,"" meteorologist Jim Cantore of The Weather Channel show Atmospheres tweeted, adding that ""his passion for tornadoes was infectious.""

According to Team Western OK Chaser, Taylor leaves behind his mother, Tracy, and dad, Jimmy, as well as a brother and sister and their children.

-908640,‘This Is Us' Details Jack's Last Day and How the Fire Started,"The popular NBC television show ""This Is Us"" spent Tuesday night's episode exploring the much-awaited cause behind the death of the character Jack, played by actor Milo Ventimiglia, the father whose death changes the lives of his children in the future.

In the episode, Jack's last moments are spent trying to spend time with his family. Jack wanted to enjoy the 1998 Super Bowl with his family and their new entertainment system that he built, but all the kids had different ideas. Kate, played by Hannah Zeile, was struggling with her self image as she had to submit another audition piece to get into college, and didn't want Jack to film her or to keep telling her how beautiful he thought she was.

Going Behind the Scenes of This Is Us With the Adorable Cast

Kate skipped the game with her father to go watch at a friend's house.

Randal, played by Niles Fitch, wanted to skip to take his girlfriend on their first date when they shared their first kiss, and Randall got the chance to tell his dad that when he got home.

Kevin, played by Logan Shroyer, fought both of his over college and ended up spending the evening with his then-girlfriend Sophie. He eventually called home to tell his mom he was sorry but waited to call his father.

Before going to bed, Jack dried some things with a dish towel, gazed at the wall where the kids' heights were recorded, and turned off the ""wonky"" crockpot, received from a neighbor. Moments later, the crockpot light goes on and off before catching on fire. The dish towel, a gift from Jack to Rebecca, wrapped around a bracelet catches on fire and makes it way onto the wall with the heights.

In last week's episode, the smoke detector is out of batteries.

This is the episode.

-908718,Singer Shakira under investigation in Spain for possible tax evasion,"Associated Press

MADRID – Pop music star Shakira is under investigation in Spain for possible tax evasion during the three years before she officially moved to Barcelona, Spanish authorities said Tuesday.

Shakira switched residences in 2015 from the Bahamas to Barcelona, where she lives with her partner, Barca soccer player Gerard Piqué, and the couple’s two sons.

Spanish tax authorities suspect the Colombian singer already lived in the northeast city between 2012 and 2014, when she allegedly failed to pay income taxes in Spain.

Prosecutor Jose Miguel Company said the tax authorities referred the probe to the Barcelona prosecutor’s office in December. He said a decision on whether to press charges or not is expected by mid-June.

Anna Forastier, a spokeswoman for auditing firm PwC, said the company has been hired by Shakira for the investigation. Forastier declined to disclose any details.

Shakira was named in the “Paradise Papers” leaks that detailed the offshore tax arrangements of numerous high-profile individuals, including musical celebrities like Madonna and U2’s Bono.

The documents obtained by German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and investigated by Spanish news website El Confidencial showed that in 2009 Shakira had relocated her intellectual property rights and brands to a company based in Malta, the tiny European Union nation that has faced allegations of being a tax heaven.

Shakira and Piqué’s relationship dates back to 2011, when Shakira started frequenting Barcelona. El Confidencial, citing papers it obtained from offshore services providers, reported that she listed the Bahamas as her official residence until 2015.

“It’s public knowledge that this is not the case,” Company told The Associated Press.

If the probe finds wrongdoing, Shakira would join a list of celebrities that have been in trouble with Spanish tax authorities, including footballers Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

In November, Shakira canceled the first concerts to promote her 11th album, El Dorado, for what she said were medical reasons. The tour is scheduled to begin in June in Germany and then stop in nine more European countries before moving to the United States.",real

Source: Creativity

It’s been 23 years since David Schwimmer starred in a TV commercial, and now we write about him on our portal twice in two days in a row. This time, he is the star of four teasers for a spot we’ll never see.

Better known as Ross Geller from Friends, Schwimmer in the commercial Skittles says it will show during Super Bowl LII to a single fan, teenager Marcos Menendez of Los Angeles.

A quartet of 15-second teasers for the secretive DDB spot were released, in which Schwimmer plays four different characters, each with a quirkiness one would expect from the “Taste the Rainbow” candy brand. In each teaser Schwimmer wears a different wig; in another, he dons a mustache. All films share the ungrammatical tagline “Exclusive the rainbow. Taste the rainbow.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEmFS50lsTw&list=PLQYWCsTsS9XlqWSjydL_r1zm8rDrwWLwE

The final commercial is set to be shown only to Menendez, according to Skittles.

Schwimmer says he was intrigued by the idea of showing a Super Bowl-worthy commercial to a single person. “I just thought it was really funny and inherently subversive,” says Schwimmer, who says Skittles’ ads appeal to his own sense of humor.

Not even the star knows which of the characters will ultimately be shown to Menendez.

“Not only do I not know, I’m not even going to see it,” Schwimmer told AdAge, and said he may try to convince someone to show him a cut of the chosen spot.",real

Affleck won the Best Actor Oscar last year for his performance in Manchester By the Sea. Long considered an underrated actor with strong performances in everything from Gone Baby Gone to Out of the Furnace and Good Will Hunting, Affleck turned in a career performance in the Kenneth Lonergan-directed film as the shell of a man haunted by past family trauma.

""#tbt when we were filming the pilot for #dawsonscreek,"" Holmes captioned the nostalgic pic taken by co-star Mary-Margaret Humes (aka Gail Leery), ending the note with a heart emoji. ""It was such a magical time and I am forever grateful to all who were involved and all of our fans.""

Holmes, who recently signed on to star in and executive produce a FBI drama pilot for Fox, was clearly in a reflective mood, celebrating The WB teen drama that launched her career. Holmes played Joey Potter, Dawson Leery's (Van Der Beek) girl next door and high school crush, who chose to be with Dawson's best friend, Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson), in the 2003 series finale.

In 2015, Holmes addressed fans' desires for a Dawson's Creek reboot or revival more than a decade years later.

""I don't want them to grow up,"" the actress told Yahoo! Style at the time, effectively nixing the notion. ""You know, it's kind of like your parents -- they never get out of their 50s, that's where they are.""

Holmes recalled having fond memories filming the show for six seasons in the seaside town of Wilmington, North Carolina. ""We just did it, we all enjoyed it,"" Holmes said. ""It was of a certain time, it was pre-Internet. There was an innocence there.""

DJ Khaled was on a radio show when he let slip that he follows Drake's classified Snapchat handle. On the other side of the pond, Daily Mail reportedly uncovered that Prince Harry has a private Instagram account so that he can follow and like his lady love Meghan Markle's posts.

Singer and Twitter-lover Adele said in an interview that she created a secret Twitter account so that she could be free to say what she felt. Her PR team kicked her off the popular app because she has been known to use choice words. It's also known that NBA player Kevin Durant has a secret account to troll back at his trolls. This was reportedly uncovered by a fan when Durant responded to a tweet in the third person. His fans think that he forgot to switch from his known account to his secret account.

It's true that the comedian racks up the LOLs whenever he's belting out hits with Adele, Ed Sheeran, Mariah Carey, Harry Styles and so many more in the comfort of his own car. The key is these sketches take place in his car.

On Sunday's (January 28), Corden decided to surprise commuters on their way to work in New York for the first-ever Subway Karaoke in celebration of the Grammy Awards coming back to NYC.

He even roped in Sting and Shaggy — who, for some reason, have made an album together — to sing the Police classic 'Every Breath You Take' and the 2000s banger 'It Wasn't Me' on the subway too.

Turns out New Yorkers don't want to hear Sting, Shaggy, Corden or anyone else singing to them on their subway ride, as you can see in the hilarious clip below:

Reactions ranged from angry passengers shouting at them, rolling their eyes or throwing money at them in order to get the trio to shut the hell up.

""We're not begging,"" a disheartened Corden complained. ""We're trying to create a viral moment.""

No one does that better than Lady Gaga, and her 2018 Grammys look didn't disappoint. Last year saw Gaga go dark with a rock and roll theme and PVC leather (complete with a fake tattoo for the occasion), but this year, the only thing that's stayed constant is the color black and her love of spectacle. To top off her ornate black Armani Privé gown, Lady Gaga went with a look that's all about contrast: black and pale makeup, platinum hair, and a braid that's wrapped in a literal black corset.

Created by Gaga's go-to hairstylist, Frederic Aspiras, her hair is nothing if not on theme. Aspiras pulled Gaga's long, white-blond hair into two complex French braids on either side of her head, and then laced the sides together with black ribbon until they met on her braid's tail. Corset braids (while certainly not new) have had a resurgence thanks to Instagram, and black ribbon is in the middle of a huge red carpet moment. Gaga's version blends the two trends in a way that's so cool it hurts.

“It has to begin with… women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level… [They need] to step up because I think they would be welcome. I don’t have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face but I think it’s upon us — us as an industry — to make the welcome mat very obvious, breeding opportunities for all people who want to be creative and paying it forward and creating that next generation of artists.”

Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich deflected when asked the same question. “It’s not for me to talk about,” he said. “I produce the TV show.” As for whether it was a mistake to not give Album of the Year nominee Lorde an onstage moment, Ehrlich answered: “I don’t know if it was a mistake. These shows are a matter of choices. We have a box and it gets full. She had a great album. There’s no way we can really deal with everybody.”

However, Lisa Loeb, Reba McEntire, Aimee Mann, and Carrie Fisher were among the female winners during the pre-telecast ceremony. Rihanna shared a win with Kendrick Lamar for best rap/sung performance for the song “Loyalty.”

Chris Stapleton, who won best country album, was more diplomatic: “It’s always a hard thing to see things not go somebody’s way,” he said. “And equality is something we have to address on a lot of levels. I can’t really speak to how voters voted and what happened there, but there is a lot of great music being made by a lot of great women. That is the only thing I know and the awards don’t diminsh the art in any way.”

-910129,Kate Middleton Secretly Donated Her 7 Inches of Hair to Kids' Cancer Charity,"Kate Middleton is known for her luscious long hair — and now it seems she’s been secretly giving it away to charity.

When Kate got her hair cut at Kensington Palace last summer, she reportedly suggested to her hair stylist, Joey Wheeler (from London’s Richard Ward salon), that they make good use of the hair he chopped off. Between them, they decided to send the hair to a charity that makes wigs for children going through cancer treatments.

According to the Sunday Express, seven inches of royal hair was anonymously sent to a charity called the Little Princess Trust. The Herefordshire-based organization makes wigs from real hair and donates them to children who have lost their own hair through chemotherapy or radiation treatments.

“It’s lovely to think that somebody, somewhere — probably more than one person — has received a wig containing Princess Kate’s hair,” Helen Creese, a spokesperson for the charity, tells PEOPLE, adding: “It’s a really lovely thought and it’s fantastic for raising awareness, plus it’s gorgeous hair — we all lust after that hair!”

Founded in 2006 by parents Wendy and Simon Tarplee in memory of their daughter Hannah, who died from cancer in 2005, the charity has since funded over 5,500 wigs for sick children — both boys and girls — and it can take anything from seven to 10 donations to make just one wig.

This isn’t the charity’s first brush with fame! Harry Styles supported the charity in 2016 by cutting off his ponytail and donating his hair. A picture he posted on social media of him holding his lobbed-off hair attracted over two million likes.

As for tracking down which mini princess (or prince!) may have received a wig containing real princess hair, it’s a hopeless task, says Creese, who adds that many donations are anonymous.

“We like to thank everyone and send out little certificates to all our donors, but lots of people don’t fill in the paperwork and they don’t feel the need to be acknowledged in that way, but we are always very grateful,” he says.",real

""Knowing what you're doing. You know what I mean?"" Jones responds. ""Since I was a little kid, I've always heard the people that don't wanna do the work. It takes work, man. The only place you find success before work is the dictionary, and that's alphabetical.""

He left you real quick; he wasn’t ‘taken’ with you.” But, alas, the host was no match for Mirren, who dropped a barrage of excellent bars atop his head.

“I’m the one you should fear, wherever I go,” Mirren shot back. “If I’m a pain in your ass, that leaves a lot of room to grow.”

Some other choice lines:

“You stand out not for games or banter. Other shows do comedy; you just pander.”

“He’s obsessed with my exes. Sorry, James, I’m not single. But you know I taught your little mister to tingle.”

“Poor James Corden will never be satisfied—until you find a way to get attention deep fried. This battle is fun. I’m glad that you asked. It’s the only bit you didn’t find in Jimmy Fallon’s trash.”

The segment was totally in keeping with Mirren’s Hollywood persona as fearless, irreverent royalty, and her skill was actually pretty impressive, even in a format that accomodates rap neophytes. The coup de grâce? “You fucked up, James. You desperate tater tot. A woman’s worth isn’t credits, or who says she’s hot. Boys’ club bullshit—I’m done with that crap. You’re welcome for this headline: ‘Helen Mirren Can Rap.’”",real
-910490,BiP's Danielle Maltby Is Dating Big Brother's Paul Calafiore,"Though her onetime flame with Wells Adams didn’t work out, Danielle Maltby has found romance with another reality star.

The Bachelor and Bachelor in Paradise alum, 32, made her relationship with Big Brother star Paul Calafiore Instagram official on Monday by sharing two Polaroid photos of the couple at a friend’s wedding.

“Melting,” Maltby wrote while Calafiore, who appeared on season 18 of the CBS franchise, captioned a similar photo with “Wedding season” and a red heart emoji.

Maltby competed on season 21 of the ABC dating competition featuring Nick Viall, who eliminated her during the seventh week. And most recently, she tried for love again during the fourth season of Bachelor in Paradise.

When Adams, 31, took over Paradise bartending duties from the beloved Jorge, the radio DJ noted that he and Maltby – both Nashville residents – had been friends in Tennessee before landing on the reality show together.

Though the longtime pals began the season insisting their relationship was platonic, their attitudes changed after they shared a goodbye kiss after Maltby decided to quit the show in pursuit of a career opportunity in Africa.

In December, Maltby said that she approved of Adams’ new relationship with Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland: “I’m so happy for him. I’ve met Sarah — Sarah is amazing.”

“They bounce off each other so well,” she said. “They bring out the best in each other. They’re both so funny and they just amp each other up so much — and the smile that Wells gets on his face is unreal. It’s so cute. It really is so cute.”",real

According to the New York Post, the Marchesa designer and estranged wife of Harvey Weinstein has decided to forgo her planned runway show on February 14 in favor of a digital presentation.

“Georgina couldn’t go through with it. She was too scared,” a source told The Post. “They were gung ho . . . but as they got closer, she choked.”

It’s been a little over three months since Chapman announced her separation from Weinstein in the wake of dozens of women coming forward with allegations of his sexual abuse. Shortly after the scandal erupted, reports surfaced of Marchesa employees leaving the company, as well as the brand’s collaboration with Helzberg Diamonds being put on hold indefinitely.

“My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,” Chapman said in a statement in October. “I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.”

As for the upcoming presentation, the brand has little to say. A spokesperson for Marchesa told The Post, “Marchesa is looking forward to presenting their Fall ’18 collection in an updated format this season.”",real
-910535,Jay Z May Be Opening a Restaurant Named Hovino,"Jay Z is apparently ready to build on his empire with a restaurant and an expansion of his clothing company.

E! News reports that Jay's company S. Carter Enterprises recently secured a trademark for the name Hovino. Under the trademark, the paperwork claims that it will be used for ""goods and services"" related to ""restaurant and café services, carry-out restaurant services, pubs, cocktail lounges, wine bars, and more."" Jay Z already owns the 40/40 Club, a sports bar and lounge, but it seems that isn't enough for the business-minded rapper. And the way Hovino sounds, we're thinking this one might have an Italian menu instead of finger foods and drinks.

But Jay Z isn't stopping there.

TMZ also reported Jay is making moves with his Roc Nation clothing brand Paper Planes. Although his company already owned the trademark for it in regards to clothing, it seems Jay wants to expand it into a full brand with athletic gym bags, tour books, jewelry, and possibly a cosmetic line. According to TMZ, the paperwork states he's looking to use the brand in a larger capacity, including department stores, an online shopping site, and for musical recordings.

The plane logo was created by Jay's business partner and childhood friend Emory Jones. The two launched the brand back in 2015.

""I think we just wanted to represent our lifestyle of where we’re at right now,"" said Jones in a GQ interview when it first launched. ""When you’re moving around the world like we are, it was like, why not? Look, we’re not trying to be a fashion brand, we’re just trying to be a part of culture. We wanted to be a part of that luxury comfort, technical space.""",real
-910499,Kendall Jenner’s BF Blake Griffin Labeled A ‘Terrible Kisser’ By Olympian Lolo Jones,"Blake Griffin, 28, can’t catch a break! After catching the world by surprise with his trade to the Detroit Pistons on Jan. 29, he now, has more shocking news being thrown his way. Former fling, Lolo Jones, 35, is slamming him as a terrible kisser. Yes, you read that correctly! The gorgeous Olympian took to Instagram to unload the big secret after a fan accused her of having a crush on Blake in the comments section of ESPN’s Sportscenter account. She quickly shut the accusation down with, “Nah I went on a date with him. Worst date of my life and he’s a terrible kisser.” Yikes, I guess Blake doesn’t score in all areas of life. We are uncertain of when their alleged date took place, but one thing’s for sure, it was short lived.

The news on Blake’s kissing abilities is not something we expected to hear, but it might explain why Kendall Jenner, 22, is relieved he’s moving to Detroit….well, maybe. As we previously reported, Kendall was not too upset over his trade, in fact she thinks it will make it easier to move on. Blake and Kendall have only been dating for four months, so it’s safe to say their relationship wasn’t very serious to begin with. Besides being spotted out together a few times, neither Kendall nor Blake ever made their love super public or Instagram official. We can only hope his bad kissing reputation has nothing to do with it.

Nevertheless, Blake’s trade to Detroit will be a huge adjustment. Blake, who is a father to two kids, Finely Elaine Griffin and Ford Wilson Cameron-Griffin, has spent the majority of his basketball career on the west coast. But being that balling is his passion, we’re sure he will settle in just fine.

Johnson and the team hope the film will convey the same kind of actor chemistry as the classic African Queen, which paired Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, according to Variety. Disney execs have been floored with early footage of Blunt in Mary Poppins Returns (due out Dec. 25) and want to keep the star in the family.

The dancer, who became a viral sensation during Katy Perry’s halftime show three years ago for seemingly botching the choreography, broke his silence to NPR and insisted his performance was intentional.

“So there’s a set choreography. There’s also what’s called freestyle choreography, or like you get to move around or play your character as a dancer, right?” the dancer, Bryan Gaw, told NPR.

“I’m in a 7-foot blue shark costume … there’s no cool in that, so what’s the other option? Well I’m gonna play a different character … this is an underdog. It’s an everyday person.”

Gaw, who toured with Perry for five years, left the road about a year ago and is now a hair stylist in West Hollywood.

During his 2015 performance, which became one of the most talked-about moments during Super Bowl halftime history, so-called “Right Shark” seemed to follow the choreography with Perry, while “Left Shark” seemed off, flailing and spinning around in circles.

Gaw’s character became an internet sensation overnight, with #LeftShark trending all over social media. But Gaw said he didn’t reveal his identity or give any interviews at the time because he didn’t draw attention away from Perry.

But today he wants people to know it’s not a bad thing to dance to the beat of your own drum.

“Don’t take life so seriously,” Gaw advised. “I was on the biggest stage in the world, acting crazy, and I got a lot of press and a lot of attention for it, in the most positive ways. It’s great. Be you. Do you.”

“You don’t have to be perfect. Nobody has to be perfect in life,” he told NPR.

-911071,3 Tips for Acing Girl-Next-Door Makeup for a Super Bowl Party,"The trick to looking cute at a Super Bowl party? Looking like you didn't try too hard to look cute. Here are a few makeup tricks that'll make you look extra adorable in that jersey but in a very girl-next-door, born-with-it way.

1. Even out your skin tone using BB cream or tinted moisturizer instead of doing full foundation, for an illusion of makeup-free flawlessness. Then go back in with concealer only where needed, like on your undereye circles and blemishes (makeup artists often apply concealer afterward like this because it prevents them from using more than necessary).

2. Dial down the eyeliner. Black can look too harsh for a Sunday afternoon; try brown or a soft neutral color instead, working the color down into your lashes so it defines your eyes without calling attention to itself. Consider just dipping an eyeliner brush into eyeshadow and using that as your liner, for an extra-natural effect.

3. Blush it up. Nothing says ""cute girl next door"" more than healthy rosy cheeks, and let's face it, reapplying lip gloss or lipstick is going to be a losing battle once the guacamole bowl comes out (and what, are you gonna daintily sip that Coors Light through a straw?). Might as well put your color pop on your cheeks.

The food, from the upscale restaurant Noma helmed by chef Rene Redzepi, was prepared but not served as the hour-plus long album played. The event space, in Manhattan’s Tribeca district, was decorated with bushes and trees as well.

However, despite the singer’s “back to nature” descriptions of the 16-track album, its music is a contemporary and characteristic fusion of R&B and pop, with electronic flourishes and occasional trap beats. (Attendees signed non-disclosure agreements forbidding them from describing the album in detail.) While addressing the crowd before the album played, Timberlake — wearing a wool cap, flannel shirt and Nikes — spoke again of the album’s “personal” nature and the inspiration he received from his family and 2-year-old son Silas, joking that “I’m not going to go all Ray LaMontagne,” referring to the singer-songwriter and labelmate known for his moody, organic sound.

His wife Jessica Biel and various members of Timberlake’s family were present, along with members of the media, music industry, and American Express cardholders who’d won a competition for tickets.

Jeremy London's been arrested for domestic violence ... and he's looking really rough in his mug shot.

-911354,Selena Gomez Completes Treatment For Depression And Anxiety,"With news that Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have finally been spotted for the first time in 2018 since she was rumoured to have fallen out with her mother, we can finally share the reason why the duo have been separated in recent weeks.

E! News has confirmed the 25-year-old recently completed a two-week treatment programme for depression and anxiety.

‘She had a difficult year, especially towards the end, and she decided she wanted to spend some time focusing on herself,’ a source told the news outlet.

‘It was all about wellness and her health.’

Selena reportedly sought professional help in New York City, months after she unfollowed her mother, Mandy Teefey, on Instagram following rumours the pair had argued over her rekindled romance with Justin.

E! News reports Bieber was aware of Gomez’s decision to seek treatment and fully supported her decision.

‘She wanted to get back to a healthy place,’ a source added. ‘She feels great.’

In 2016, the ‘Bad Liar’ singer cancelled 34 remaining dates on her Revival world tour to seek treatment at a Tennessee facility to help her with anxiety, panic attacks and depression.

Picking up the award for favourite female pop/rock artist at the AMAs that year, the singer-turned-actress revealed: ‘I was absolutely broken inside.

‘I’m not trying to get validation nor do I need it anymore. All I can say is that from the bottom of my heart I’m so grateful to be able to share what I love every single day with the people that I love.’

The news of Gomez’s recent treatment comes a day after the rumoured couple were spotted attending a church service and hockey match together in Los Angeles.

‘They were very happy to see everyone there and were giving lot of hugs and saying hello as they entered,’ an eyewitness told E! News. ‘They both seemed happy and relaxed.’

We’re glad to see Gomez prioritising her health.

-911518,Sources: Netflix Paid Paramount More Than $50 Million for ‘Cloverfield Paradox’,"Super Bowl viewers were shocked when Netflix dropped an ad for The Cloverfield Paradox, revealing that the J.J. Abrams-produced movie heretofore known as God Particle would forgo a theatrical release and instead debut on the streaming service immediately following the big game on Sunday.

The marketing stunt capped a rescue plan hatched by Abrams, Paramount chairman-CEO Jim Gianopulos, Netflix chief Ted Sarandos and head of original films Scott Stuber, among others.

Worried that Cloverfield Paradox would perish at the box office — it was set to hit theaters April 20 after several delays — Paramount and Abrams handed it to Netflix, which is willing to shell out big bucks for high-profile content.

The deal, broached over the holidays and finalized in January, is worth north of $50 million, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter, with Paramount retaining rights for China and home entertainment.

It makes the movie instantly profitable for the studio, which avoids a (likely) misfire and costly marketing campaign. And Netflix got what it was looking for, regardless of withering reviews (18 percent on Rotten Tomatoes at press time): buzz.

“It gets them attention and captures some viewing right off the bat,” says eMarketer’s Paul Verna. And even if the streamer doesn’t ultimately get the viewership it hoped for Paradox, “they still got a brand jolt,” he adds.

Cloverfield Paradox, which finished principal photography in September 2016, was part of the successful and popular Cloverfield series, but sources say Gianopulos, who joined Paramount six months later, was worried.

Despite additions to clarify character beats and tie the film to the franchise’s universe, it was ultimately deemed unsalvageable, even with a cast led by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Elizabeth Debicki, David Oyelowo and Daniel Bruhl.

Netflix was an obvious destination, having already taken over international rights to the Natalie Portman starrer Annihilation, which Paramount will release domestically Feb. 23.

Paramount retains the rights to future Cloverfield installments. Overlord, a World War II zombie film from Abrams that scored high in two recent test screenings, could be a contender, although sources say that its fate is still undetermined.

CNN —

Pink may have been sick when she performed the National Anthem at the Super Bowl, but it didn’t stop her sass.

The singer is known for being outspoken and was no less so after a Twitter user criticized her performance.

A user known as @King_Sullivan tweeted, “If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it 1000 times. Pink sucks and if you like her singing you’re dumb #SuperBowl.” Pink clapped back.

If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it 1000 times. Pink sucks and if you like her singing you’re dumb #SuperBowl — Simp Bizkit (@King_Sullivan) February 4, 2018

“Yeah but altleast I suck while singing our countries national anthem, and you just suck by yourself on a dirty couch,” Pink tweeted.

Pink is a native of Philadelphia and was majorly stoked to be performing at Super Bowl LII between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots (not to mention that the Eagles went on to win).

But unfortunately she was felled by the flu just prior to her performance.

On Saturday she posted an Instagram photo of herself “Trying to practice the flu away.”

Pink wrote she’d “been waiting to sing [the national anthem at the Super Bowl] since 1991 when I saw my idol, Whitney Houston, own this song” but unfortunately got sick.

“And it just so happens that this chance comes when I have two small Petri dish kids who literally cough INTO MY MOUTH and rub their snot on my cheek,” she wrote. “You can’t write this stuff I swear! And here we are.”

But the singer powered through, even spitting out a throat lozenge right before performing (a moment that of course social media users caught though they initially thought it was gum).

Pink shared her thanks with fans on Twitter.

“All of your prayers and well wishes and candles got me through today,” she tweeted. “Thankyou so much for all the love and support. We [heart] you. #SuperBowl2018.”",real
-911725,Sarah Silverman and Michael Sheen Broke Up Because of Trump and Brexit,"Trumpism and Brexit are often said to have failed to bring people together, and now the twin votes are being blamed for shattering one celebrity couple’s love affair.

The British actor Michael Sheen has claimed that he and the comedian Sarah Silverman broke up because of their passion for politics, and it wasn’t that they disagreed.

Both, in fact hold similarly anti-populist views, but, in a new interview, Sheen says that he and Silverman parted ways because she wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, and he wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.

Sheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the ’30s, told the Daily Telegraph that he was inspired to become more politically active by the Brexit referendum.

At the time, he and Silverman were living together in the U.S., but the votes signaled the end of their four-year relationship.

“We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions—because she is American and I’m Welsh.

“After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.

“I felt a responsibility to do something, but it did mean coming back here—which was difficult for us, because we were very important to each other. But we both acknowledge that each of us had to do what we needed to do.”

Sheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.

As the Telegraph says, Sheen “sounds a little wistful” about politics coming before love.",real

In the one-minute teaser for the upcoming second season, things in the Chicago lawyer circuit aren't looking too good as attorneys are being targeted by unhappy clients and begin dying under suspicious circumstances -- and worst yet, sometimes in cold blood.

""I don't know what's going on in the world anymore,"" Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) says, as she struggles to make sense of it all. ""It feels like death is everywhere.""

Sure enough, it's about to get worse for Diane and company, many of whom have -- as the trailer suggests -- become more and more conscientious of their surroundings, increasingly nervous about their clients and wary of their safety.

But the race against time to stop the anti-lawyer sentiment reaches a boiling point: Marissa Gold (Sarah Steele) opens up an envelope with a typed-out letter and a threat, ""Kill All Lawyers,"" in blood-red letters and a mysterious white-powdered substance that pours down her lap and into Maia Rindell's (Rose Leslie) hands.

""Sh*t.""

Watch the intense trailer below.

The Good Fight premieres Sunday, March 4 on CBS All Access.

-912003,"Eagles QB Carson Wentz cleared for return, will start against Colts","PHILADELPHIA – Carson Wentz will be the Eagles’ starting quarterback on Sunday.

Head coach Doug Pederson announced Monday the third-year signal caller has been medically cleared nine months after tearing his left anterior cruciate ligament and will lead the Birds’ offense against the Colts at Lincoln Financial Field.

“He’s cleared, he goes,” Pederson said less than 24 hours after Philly’s first loss of the season, a 27-21 setback in Tampa Bay. “I’ve said all along that he’s our guy. We drafted him to be our guy.”

Wentz was injured during the Eagles’ 43-35 victory over the Rams on Dec. 10 last year.

Nick Foles replaced Wentz as the starter and led the team to its first-ever Super Bowl championship, winning game MVP honors in the process.

All things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.

However, despite Foles’ accomplishments, which included a 334-yard, one-touchdown effort against the Bucs on Sunday, there was no ill will on his demotion, according to Pederson.

“The greatest thing for me is that room has no egos,” Pederson said. “Nick all along has understood that this is Carson’s football team, we drafted Carson to be the guy and we owe a lot of gratitude to Nick Foles for what he’s done, what he has done, obviously what he’s done this season, and how he’s led this football team and he’s a pro’s pro. No egos, they check ‘em at the door and he’ll be very supportive, has been very supportive and will be that way from here on.”

Wentz threw for 3,296 yards and 33 touchdowns in just 13 games last season, finishing third in the MVP voting.

While Pederson admitted it’ll take some time for Wentz to “get back into the rhythm and the flow of the game,” he’s confident Wentz will find his legs again.

“Just watching him move around physically and some of the things he’s done, you know he’s ready,” Pederson said. “He’s ready to take the reins again and move forward.”",real

As a result, my phone is now home to every brand and retail app on the planet, each at the ready for swiping and shopping-cart-filling aplenty. This sounds almost ridiculous as I type it. I consider myself to be a smart person. Smart people don’t spend money recklessly. There are very few things I consider hard to admit, but this is one of them. Always being independent and being on my own has been a point of pride for me. And like eating too many sweets when you’re on a strict diet, there is a deep shame in spending this way. I’m a grown-up, but surgery, sadness, and immobility had me acting like a child: stomping my feet like Veruca Salt. I want what I want when I want it, dammit!",real
-911996,Kim Kardashian Forgot to Tell Scott Disick About Third Baby,"Scott Disick is feeling left out of the loop.

On Sunday’s upcoming episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the father of three — he shares sons Mason, 8, and Reign, 3, and daughter Penelope, 5, with ex Kourtney Kardashian — learns that Kim Kardashian West is expecting a third child — and is apparently one of the last people that are close to the Kimoji creator to know.

“I’ll be quite honest. I don’t even know what this room is,” Disick, 34, says in an E! clip as Kardashian West, 37, guides him around an unfinished room in her home, which she was preparing for daughter Chicago, whom she welcomed Jan. 15.

“Nursery,” she tells him.”So like the little open tub, crib …”

A bewildered Disick asks, “For another baby?”

Still not understanding that she will soon be welcoming a third child via surrogacy with husband Kanye West — the couple also shares daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2 — Disick inquires, “Do you really think you need to worry about redoing these cabinets if this is going to be a nursery for a kid that you don’t even have?” before directly asking, “Are you pregnant?”

Not understanding why Disick is presumably joking, Kardashian West says, “Is this a joke? Do you not know we’re having another baby?”

He tells her with a laugh: “Not really.”

“Scott, we’re having a baby in like a couple of months. I’m dead serious,” she explains to a surprised Disick, who asks if she’s carrying.

“No I’m not,” she says. “We went the surrogacy route. I never had this conversation with you? I swear I’m not joking with you.”

Disney Channel released a trailer Friday featuring the first footage from their upcoming live-action TV movie version of Kim Possible.

Sadie Stanley stars in the movie as the eponymous red-headed teenager and Alyson Hannigan plays Kim’s mom. Christy Carlson Romano and Patton Oswalt have both signed on as well. Romano voiced the title character in the original animated Kim Possible series, while Oswalt voiced super villain Professor Dementor. We don’t know what roles the two will play in the movie, but we do know who Kim will be facing off against: mad scientist Dr. Drakken (Todd Stashwick) and his sarcastic partner in crime, Shego (Taylor Ortega).

In November, EW exclusively revealed the first photos of Stashwick and Ortega in character.

Co-director Adam B. Stein and Zach Lipovsky told EW at the time that they ultimately decided to forgo animated Drakken’s signature blue skin in favor of creating a character that is more grounded and less, well, cartoony.

“It’s like he’s got a blue infection within,” Lipovsky said of the new Drakken. “It’s like some experiment or some dastardly plan went wrong years ago and now he’s got this side effect where he’s got a bluish hue.”

The live-action Kim Possible movie will premiere in 2019. Immediately following Kim Possible, Disney Channel will present a first look at the new eight-part miniseries Fast Layne. The miniseries will move to its regular timeslot with a second installment on Feb. 17 at 8 p.m.

Sources familiar with the case tell us on Wednesday Nicole met the L.A. County Deputy D.A., who is reviewing the case. Our sources say the D.A. found Nicole's allegations ""credible."" As we reported, Eggert claimed Baio repeatedly molested her between ages 14 and 18. Baio insists they had sex only once ... when she was 18.

Our sources say the D.A. called the case ""potentially prosecutable"" ... were it not for the statute of limitations.

Under current law there's no statute of limitations if an adult sexually assaults a minor. But, when the alleged assaults occurred in the '80s, the statute of limitations was 3 years, which means it has long since run out.

There's an argument that old cases could still be prosecuted if the statute hadn't run when the law changed, but in this case the statute ran before the law changed, so case closed.

Eggert tells TMZ, ""I always knew this case was beyond statutes of limitations and unfortunately the DA would not be able to prosecute Scott Baio. However I also knew the importance of laying the groundwork for any future victims of Baio's that may come forward and to warn parents who might unknowingly allow their children to be alone with this molester.""

Following allegations of sexual harassment and a subsequent investigation, Marciano resigned as executive chairman on Tuesday.

Allegations included “inappropriate comments and texts and unwanted advances including kissing and groping.” Investigators reviewed approximately 1.5 million pages of documents and interviewed more than 40 people. Nevertheless, Guess was unable to conclusively determine the veracity of the allegations leveled against Marciano in its investigation.

In its filing, Guess said that “many of the allegations could not be corroborated,” but did note that “on certain occasions Paul Marciano exercised poor judgment in his communications with models and photographers.” In addition, the investigation found that Marciano did “place himself in situations in which plausible allegations of improper conduct could, and did, arise.”

Guess said that Marciano reached settlements with five individuals, totaling $500,000. The names of the individuals were not released; however, supermodel Kate Upton has been public with her allegations of harassment and unwanted advances.

Marciano’s resignation was reportedly voluntary. He plans to step down from the company’s board at the end of his contract on Jan. 30.

Scott, who was charged under his real name Jacques Webster, was arrested and initially charged with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor in May 2017 during his concert.

His attorney, Doug Norwood, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.

Norwood told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that while Scott pled guilty his two misdemeanor charges were dismissed through plea negotiations in January. He said it’s likely the disorderly conduct charge could eventually be expunged from the rapper’s record.

“They overcharged him,” Norwood said. “They tried to get him for inciting a riot. The video did not show any of that.”

The publication reported the rapper was required to pay $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert, including $640 in court associated costs.

Keith Foster, a spokesman for the Rogers Police Department, told PEOPLE at the time that Scott had “encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass security protocols to ensure concert goer safety.”

“During the rush to the stage several people were injured, including an employee from the security company hired to help monitor and control the crowd, and a member of the police department. The injured subjects were treated at the AMP by members of the Rogers Fire Department and Mercy Medical.”

Scott recently welcomed newborn daughter Stormi Webster with girlfriend Kylie Jenner.

Recommended Videos

Coming to us by way of Twitter (h/t CBM), this is by no means the full deleted scene, and has instead been edited so that fans are left wanting that little bit more. Nevertheless, it offers a pretty good look at the sinister symbiote being triggered by a car alarm – much to the amazement of a young kid, who can do nothing but gawk at Venom as the inky-black monster makes short work of the doomed automobile.

Feast thy eyes:

This particular snippet is one of three deleted/extended scenes set to be included on the Venom Blu-ray – the other two concern Eddie and Venom’s ride to the hospital, while the third is said to offer up an extended version of the post-credits scene at San Quentin. Could that mean that we’ll get a better look at Woody Harrelson’s Carnage? Who knows?

What we do know, however, is that a Venom sequel is nigh on certain, after Sony’s budding franchise-starter blew past all expectations on its journey to $850M worldwide. To put that eye-watering cume into perspective, that’s higher than Wonder Woman and both Deadpool movies, proving that, while critics came down hard on the standalone adventure, there was still a big, big appetite for the sinister symbiote.

Exactly where things go from here is another question entirely, but we understand Sony’s Marvel Universe is working towards new spinoff projects for Kraven, Silk, Silver and Black, and Morbius, the latter of which will star Jared Leto as the undead anti-hero. Color us intrigued.

“We’re using technical terms… we shower together, and [we say], ‘This is what I’ve got. This is what you’ve got,’” she said at the conference, according to Billboard. “We just talk about it. I know it’s really young, but I really believe that if you start this early, there’s no shame.”

“I don’t want to tell him, ‘Keep your private parts,’ and this and that,” she added. “It’s a beautiful thing. You have it and mine is different and it’s cool, man. We have to respect ourselves and respect each other. So I believe it starts really young.”

Biel’s comments come just after the actress starred in a sex education PSA alongside comedian Chelsea Handler.

The PSA — titled “Jessica Biel and Chelsea Handler Take a Little Look-See” — stresses how important it is for women to give themselves regular self-examinations.

“You have to check in with your vagina! How else do you know what’s going on down there?” Handler instructs in the short clip.

“You know, sometimes I look at my vagina, and I go, ‘Wow, that looks like a young, smug Burt Reynolds — with the mustache,'” Biel says.

“Up until this point, I’ve only been sexually attracted to women,” Garfield says. “My stance toward life, though, is that I always try to surrender to the mystery of not being in charge. I think most people — we’re intrinsically trying to control our experience here, and manage it, and put walls around what we are and who we are. I want to know as much of the garden as possible before I pass — I have an openness to any impulses that may arise within me at any time.”

He continues, “But, if I were to identify, I would identify as heterosexual, and being someone who identifies that way, and who’s taking on this seminal role, my scariest thought was, ‘Am I allowed to do this?’ ”

The actor sparked backlash from the LGBT community in July 2017 when he was starring in the London production of the play and stated that he was a“gay man right now, just without the physical act.”

Garfield later said his comments were “twisted” and “taken out of context,” clarifying that he was referring to how he was immersed in gay culture while preparing for the role.

There's no question that the wellness advice Gwyneth Paltrow preaches on her website Goop are controversial. But for many readers, the website's recent article on how to obtain ""your leanest livable weight"" is taking controversy to a new level.

The 45-year-old actress and her lifestyle brand are under fire for promoting severe weight loss and teaching people ""how to be as thin as possible without dying,"" according to one critic. Last week, Goop published an article titled ""Busting Diet Myths."" The article was promoted on its Twitter with the caption, ""Why diets don't work, the role of willpower, and achieving your leanest livable weight.""

Immediately, Paltrow and her website were slammed for advocating thinness and encouraging unhealthy weight loss. According to the article, a person's ""‘leanest livable weight' is the weight at the low end of [one's] ‘set range.' Your set range is a genetically determined range of weight that your body generally keeps you in.""

Critics took fault with the term leanest livable weight, which many believed translated into Goop encouraging its readers to slim down to the lowest weight they can maintain while still living.

Paul shared the meaning behind his daughter’s name while appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Friday, March 16th.It turns out that the story behind Story’s name is pretty incredible.

It all goes back to Aaron and Lauren’s first date. The two famously met at Coachella, then met up in Las Vegas for an official first date that’s like something you’d only see in a rom-com.

“We did a dinner and a show and we drove back in this old car that I bought in Vegas,” the actor, who now stars in Hulu’s The Path, said. “That night we actually bought our unborn baby a leather jacket, and we went to a chapel to get married.” He paused for dramatic effect, then proceeded to explain, “But the chapel happened to be closed. And so we took that as a sign and just waited.” OMG.

But wait — there’s more. “And, no joke, we took $200 and won 16 grand on blackjack. This is a true story.” Because that story is so amazing, Paul and his wife decided that their daughter is their “little Story.” It’s pretty fitting, as the tale of how her mother and father met will blow everyone’s minds for all of eternity.

Watch Paul tell Fallon about the most incredible first date ever.

You even get to see a picture of Baby Story wearing the leather jacket.

-912918,Ariana Grande has PTSD after Manchester attack,"CNN —

Singer Ariana Grande has spoken about suffering post-traumatic stress disorder following a suicide bombing that killed 22 people at her concert in Manchester, United Kingdom, last year.

“I know those families and my fans, and everyone there experienced a tremendous amount of it as well,” said Grande of suffering the symptoms of PTSD, in an interview with British Vogue to be released on Friday.

“I feel like I shouldn’t even be talking about my own experience – like I shouldn’t even say anything,” added the 24-year-old American, who appears on the cover of the magazine’s July edition.

PTSD is a form of anxiety disorder that occurs when intrusive memories linked to fear from a traumatic event become consolidated in a person’s mind by them visualizing the event in a loop until it becomes locked in their brain.

Grande said she didn’t think she’d ever be able to talk about the attack at Manchester Arena in May 2017 “and not cry.”

Attacker Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of Grande’s concert, as people were leaving the packed arena.

Many of the victims were teenage fans, the youngest among them 8-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos from Leyland, north of Manchester.

Inside the July issue, @ArianaGrande shares details of her difficult and transformative past year with Vogue: https://t.co/FociKiCJnD pic.twitter.com/teENfb8HfQ — British Vogue (@BritishVogue) June 4, 2018

“It’s hard to talk about because so many people have suffered such severe, tremendous loss,” Grande told Vogue during the interview at her home in Beverly Hills.

“Time is the biggest thing,” she said of recovering from the trauma.

One year on: remembering the victims

Following the first anniversary of the attack, Grande last month revealed a bee tattoo beneath her ear in commemoration of the tragedy.

The worker bee is often used as an emblem for Manchester, representing the city’s industrial past and appearing in its crest.

Services were also held across Manchester to mark the anniversary of the attack, with Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May among the dignitaries attending.",real
-912961,Kim Kardashian West Has a Surprising Opinion on Scott Disick's Love Life,"Scott Disick is officially in a relationship with 19-year-old Sofia Richie, but not everyone in the Kardashian family agrees on the best way to approach it.

Disick shares three kids with his ex Kourtney Kardashian, which could make things complicated, though Kourtney seems happy to focus on doing her own thing at the beach with her new beau Younes Bendjima. Her sister Kendall Jenner, on the other hand, has spent time calling out Disick and Richie's age difference (Disick is 34) on Instagram with shady comments.

But what does Kim Kardashian West think of it all? It turns out she approves.

""I've started to see pictures of Scott running around New York and whatever makes him happy—I don't judge, I don't care,"" Kim said on Sunday night's episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. ""I think it's a good thing. I just hope that he's making good choices and having fun and nothing's getting crazy.""

Kim's mom Kris Jenner took a slightly different approach. Instead of hashing out her own feelings about the new couple, she asked Disick directly about it.

“What’s going on? Are you dating?�? she asked. “Are you dating one person? Just one? You’re going steady?�?

“I guess that’s what the kids are calling it,�? Disick replied vaguely.

“Is it Sofia?�? Jenner whispered before Disick confirmed. “Wait, how old is she? Because I really don’t know. Is she Kylie’s age?�?

""19,"" Disick said succinctly.

While Disick is older than Richie, age differences are really nothing new in the Kardashian family. Kris herself had a 12 year age difference in her relationship with the late Robert Kardashian. Disick's ex Kourtney also has an age difference with her boyfriend, since she is 38 and Bendjima is 24, which is almost exactly the same sized gap as Richie and Disick.",real

As much as she loves to exercise, the 30-year-old actress also loves to indulge, admitting that she's all about creating balance in her life.

""I think having healthy skin [also] comes from being happy and having a balanced life. I work hard, I play hard; I eat a lot, I work out a lot,"" she says. ""I'm not the kind of person who says 'I eat pizza' but then doesn't really eat it. I eat the pizza! And I don't stress out about it.""

""I've learned that as long as you're moving, you can have the food you want,"" she continues. ""Every one of us has insecurities. I have a whole bunch of them, but I don’t dwell on them. Instead I focus on my strengths. After all, what’s the worst thing that can happen if you try something new and it doesn’t work out? So what?""

That confidence has allowed Mitchell to pursue different opportunities, no matter how much they may scare her. ""You don’t know what you’re going to be good at until you do it! The same goes for travel: Explore the world; don’t be afraid of it. Get out there and be adventurous -- that’s my life motto,"" she expresses.

-913571,Bill Paxton’s family files wrongful death suit,"CNN —

The family of Bill Paxton believes his death last year was preventable, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family against the hospital and surgeon who treated the late actor.

Paxton, whose career credits included roles in “Titanic,” “Aliens,” and HBO’s “Big Love,” died February 25, 2017, just days after undergoing heart surgery. He was 61.

Paxton’s family alleges the surgeon used “a high risk and unconventional surgical approach with which he lacked experience” and that the hospital and surgeon, “misrepresented and/or concealed information relating to the risks of surgery,” according to the suit.

They believe those factors contributed to Paxton’s post-surgery complications.

“Bill Paxton and his family trusted the physicians and staff at this medical facility but instead Cedars-Sinai betrayed their trust,” the family’s attorney Bruce Broillet said in a statement. “The surgeon’s actions resulted in this tragic and preventable death.”

In a statement, Cedars-Sinai said state and federal privacy laws prohibit it from “commenting about patient care without written authorization.” But, the statement added, “Nothing is more important to Cedars-Sinai than the health and safety of our patients.”

“These remain our top priorities,” the statement said. “One of the reasons for our high quality is that we thoroughly review concerns about any patient’s medical care. This process ensures that we can continue to provide the highest quality care.”

Paxton’s death certificate officially lists his cause of death as stroke after heart surgery.

Paxton was survived by his two children, James and Lydia, and his wife of 30 years, Louise Paxton.

Using Arielle Kebbel’s Instagram account, the director of promotions at NBCUniversal wrote her story captioned under a photo of herself looking at a sunset on a cliffside. “My name is Julia Kebbel. I have bipolar disorder and suffered a severe episode at the end of January 2018,” the post read. “It led to me experiencing a psychotic break from reality, during which time, I went missing with my dog, Cindy.”

Julia thanked her loved ones and “good Samaritans” who helped her during the frightening ordeal, also revealing that she is “grateful for the treatment and care” she is receiving for her mental illness.

“I would like to thank every person involved in the search for us for your incredible outpouring of support and love,” she added. “On my road to recovery, I am hoping to help raise awareness of mental health disorders, including fighting the stigmatization of these illnesses that affect so many. I proudly stand with you. — With love and gratitude, Julia Kebbel.”

In a Feb. 3 Instagram post, Kebbel sent out an alert that her sister had gone missing in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles while walking her chocolate Labrador retriever. The actress went on to file an official missing persons report with the LAPD. Two weeks later, Kebbel shared the news that her sister and dog had been found.

“It is with great joy and relief that I share the wonderful news that my sister, Julia, and her dog, Cindy, have been found safe,” the actress wrote on Instagram. “While we do ask for privacy at this time, my family and I want to thank everyone for all of your love and support over the past two weeks. We are so grateful to every single person who helped spread the word and joined us in our search. We would also like to thank the Los Angeles Police Department, KlaasKIDS, SERT Ministries and Anonymity Rescue for their efforts in bringing Julia home.”",real

It’s been over a year since the Annihilation actress, 36, made her last appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in December 2016, and since then Portman has welcomed another child with husband Benjamin Millepied.

Recalling her pregnant body as “enormous” during Wednesday’s episode of the NBC daytime show, the Oscar winner congratulates host Ellen DeGeneres on correctly guessing the gender of daughter Amalia, who was born in February 2017.

And DeGeneres had even put money on it.

“You wouldn’t tell anybody what the sex was and I guessed. And you really didn’t know,” she reminds Portman, who reveals: “I maybe did but I maybe didn’t want to tell everybody in the world. I still made the bet because I thought it would show either way.”

PEOPLE confirmed in early March that Portman and Millepied had welcomed their baby girl. The couple, who married in 2012, is also parents to son Aleph, now 6.

“But I kept good on my bet. Ellen bet $1,000 … You were confident, you were right to be confident, it’s a girl!” says Portman, who reveals that she made a $1,000 donation to the Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund.

Though Portman and Millepied, who met on the set of the 2010 hit thriller Black Swan, are notoriously private about their family life, the actress opened up about how parenthood has changed her for The New York Times’ T Magazine.

“[Parenthood] made me much calmer under stress, because there’s that weird parent thing you develop, that when things get really bad, your voice gets calm and your blood pressure slows, and you can make everything okay again,” Portman wrote at the time.

7 Female Firsts in Sports

Lipinski donned her first pair of skates at age six. In 1994, at age 12, she won a gold medal at the U.S. Olympic Festival, a junior-level competition. In 1997, Lipinski, then 14, took first place at both the national and world figure skating championships, beating out her American rival and perennial fan favorite, Michelle Kwan. Lipinski was the youngest person ever to take home either title.

At the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Lipinski and teammate Michelle Kwan were both considered favorites for the gold medal. Earlier that season, the diminutive Lipinski, known for her energetic jumps, had been defeated twice in competition by Kwan, who was considered the more artistic skater of the two. Both Kwan and Lipinski turned in strong performances; however, Lipinski’s program was considered more technically difficult and she was awarded the gold medal. Kwan took home the silver medal and China’s Chen Lu won the bronze. Lipinski, then 15, was the youngest person in figure skating history to capture Olympic gold. (At the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, 16-year-old Oksana Baiul from Ukraine won the gold in women’s figure skating.)

In April 1998, Lipinski announced she was turning professional. She went on to perform in skating shows such as “Stars on Ice” and also pursued an acting career. She retired from figure skating in 2002. In 2006, she was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame.",real

They’re soft, make you feel like a teddy bear, and are a favorite of celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Hailey Baldwin, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and Elsa Hosk. (Just to name a few.) The coat is so popular that three of the four have worn the exact same one.

On Valentine’s Day, Kardashian stepped out in Los Angeles wearing a fuzzy Balenciaga shearling teddy coat. The “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” star paired the light-brown trench—which retails for a whopping $5,600—with gray sweat pants, a hot-pink sports bra, and white heeled booties.

If the coat looked familiar, it’s because three of fashion’s most notable “It” girls wore near-identical jackets a couple months prior. Huntington-Whiteley was the first to wear it when she stepped out in New York City in December bundling herself up in Max Mara’s Teddy Bear Icon Coat. (Not exactly the same as Kim’s but pretty close.)

A day after Huntington-Whiteley paired the coat with luxe leggings and pleather booties, Hosk styled the outerwear with cropped light-washed jeans and a denim shirt. Baldwin kept the casual looking going a month later in January with a messy bun and comfy sneakers.

If Kardashian’s $5,600 Balenciaga coat is out of your price range, you won’t have much luck with Hosk, Huntington-Whiteley, and Baldwin’s favorite. The fashion girls’ Max Mara favorite retails at $3,950—about $1,600 less than Kardashian’s, but still a pricy buy.

Aniston was all smiles, looking casual in jeans, a gray T-shirt and a matching coat as she left Nello restaurant on Tuesday -- just three days after she and Theroux both attended Jimmy Kimmel's son's birthday party in Los Angeles.

A source tells ET that Aniston is ""back in her old New York routine, staying in midtown [at the Four Seasons], instead of downtown, where she had started staying instead when she was with Justin.”

Splash News

Theroux, meanwhile, is in Los Angeles. The 46-year-old actor was photographed rocking his signature black leather look as he arrived at the Chateau Marmont hotel after a night out in Hollywood with friends on Monday.

A source told ET after the pair's breakup in February that one of the major factors in their split was Theroux's resistance to the Hollywood lifestyle.

""He much prefers being [in New York] and that's been a major issue for them for a long time,"" the source said, adding that the actor's roots are deep in the Big Apple, and that his friends and social group, which Theroux holds close to his heart, are all based in the city.

“Justin has a very diverse friend group, and he likes that they're not all 'in the industry,'"" the source continued. ""He's friends with people in the restaurant world, writers, comedians, artists, tattoo artists. It's an eclectic group and he doesn't have that type of network in L.A.""

And while Aniston grew up in New York and started her career there, ET's source said that she ""just never really could get settled in. She wasn't happy [in New York].""

The ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" star is selling the pieces via eBay.com, and 10 percent of the proceeds from the sale will benefit the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles.

Among the over 200 items are a Vivienne Westwood skirt, Alexander McQueen boots, a Tom Ford turtleneck, and Gucci striped sweatpants. Baby items are also included in the sale.



Bids for the pieces start at just $1.00 and the auction will run until February 25.

Kardashian, who recently welcomed her third child with husband Kanye West via surrogate, has been a longtime supporter of the hospital, and last year, she opened up about why she gives her time to the facility.

""You know, this hospital is really important to me,"" she said at the Make March Matter campaign event. ""I've actually had friends that have had their babies here and I've spent, you know, weeks on end with them visiting them.""

""My family and I always love to come here and throughout the year, just try to pop in and put a smile on your kids' faces or, more importantly, the families that are struggling so hard to still work and take care of them and not wanting to leave their children by themselves,"" she continued. ""So anything we can do, and my family can do, we love being a part of this community and helping out.""

-914551,Marilyn Manson 'cuts concert short after onstage outburst calling next tour stop a s***hole',"Marilyn Manson in the press room during The Fashion Awards 2016 at the Royal Albert Hall, London

Shock rocker Marilyn Manson left fans fuming on Thursday after cutting short a concert in New York following an onstage outburst.

The show at The Paramount concert hall in Long Island had already started 90 minutes late, and after performing just five songs, the Beautiful People singer then began mumbling into his microphone as he walked across the stage, pushing over an amp as he did so.

Manson, real name Brian Warner, then rambled about having just travelled from Boston, Massachusetts, and allegedly slammed New Jersey - the location of his next tour stop - by branding it a ""s**thole"", before throwing his mic and exiting the stage during a bandmate's extended guitar solo, according to TMZ.

When the star failed to return, the venue's lights came on and security officials told the crowd to head towards the doors.

One concert-goer told Newsday, ""He was too messed up and couldn't perform. It was disappointing,"" while another vented on Twitter, ""Marilyn Manson put on the WORST show I have ever seen. Played 5 songs, b**ched about people not saying 'I Love You' and walked off"".

Many attendees are now calling on promoters to issue a refund for the gig, which had originally been due to take place in October but had to be postponed after Manson broke his leg in an onstage mishap in New York in late September.

The star returned to the stage in November and has been performing with a cast on his leg ever since.

Selena Gomez's kidney transplant almost killed her, according to her best friend Francia Raisa who donated the organ.

The singer underwent the three-hour surgery for her battle with lupus.

In an interview with W, Raisa discussed how things became near-fatal during the procedure. The Grown-ish actress described the recovery as ""hard.""

She said, ""I didn't want to eat, I didn't want to drink anything. Selena did have a complication, too. A few hours after our surgery, I woke up and had a text from her that said, ‘I'm really scared. My kidney was very active, and when it turned I broke an artery.'

Raisa said they had her go into emergency surgery ""to get a vein from her leg and build a new artery"" so that the kidney would stay in place.

""She could have died,"" Raisa said.

Following their surgeries, Gomez posted a photo of she and Raisa together explaining what had been going on with her health.

Gomez first discussed her lupus publicly in 2015 after flying under the radar to focus on healing.

“I was diagnosed with [autoimmune disease] lupus, and I’ve been through chemotherapy,"" she told Billboard. ""That’s what my break was really about. I could’ve had a stroke.”

Since her transplant, Gomez has been back working on season two of 13 Reasons Why and on her next album.

At a TimesTalk Q&A to promote her new movie, Red Sparrow, Lawrence was asked what she would do if she had her latest character's spying skills in real life. She said she would put her powers to use to figure out what is going on between one-time inseparable besties Swift and Kloss.

""I’d like to know what’s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift, that’s the honest to God truth,"" she said, according to People. She added that trying figure out ""what happened"" is ""keeping me up at night.""

In case you need a refresher, rumors of a fallout between Swift and Kloss have been swirling for a while. Here's the evidence fans have pointed to as proof that the two aren't on good terms:

Exhibit A: Taylor leaves Karlie's name off her Junior Jewels shirt in her ""Look What You Made Me Do"" video.

YouTube

The shirt did feature the names of several of Swift's current squad, including Selena Gomez, Ed Sheeran, Gigi Hadid, Lena Dunham, Martha Hunt, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds.

Exhibit B: Karlie captions an Instagram ""Swish Swish.""

The post was a video of Karlie dribbling a basketball for a Love magazine shoot. The ""swish swish"" caption (which many interpreted to be a reference to the Katy Perry diss track widely believed to be about Taylor) drew so much criticism that Karlie changed it to ""nothing but net.""

Exhibit C: Karlie hangs out with Katy Perry.

In early February, TMZ published photos of Katy and Karlie grabbing dinner with mutual friends and since it's apparently impossible to be friends with both Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, this was taken as damning evidence of a rift.

All Jennifer Lawrence needs is a little real-life spy training—or a chance to interview Taylor or Karlie while subbing in for a late night host, maybe—to get to the bottom of this.",real

Following the flood of tweets dragging Fergie through the mud, the funny lady, who is known for her brash comedy, hopped on the trashing bandwagon.

The 65-year-old, who is coming back to TV with a revival of her beloved sitcom Roseanne, wrote, ""Who saw Fergie's national anthem performance at the NBA All Star Game? I think mine was better lowkey.""

Just in case you need a refresher on Roseanne's performance so you know how much of a diss that really was, here's what we got: On July 26, 1990, the sitcom star took to Jack Murphy field, shrieked, grabbed her crotch and purposefully made a mockery of the beloved song, known for opening up sports games. It's universally known as the worst performance of the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" that has ever been done since Francis Scott Key put pen to paper in 1814.

Afterward, the entire country was outraged, including President George H.W. Bush, who called it ""disgraceful.""

So Roseanne saying her performance was better is pretty brutal.",real
-914869,'SNL' Alum Colin Quinn Is Recovering After Suffering Heart Attack on Valentine's Day,"Colin Quinn is thanking his friends and fans for wishing him well as he continues to recover after suffering a heart attack last week.

With his trademark sense of humor, the Saturday Night Live alum, 58, broke the news on Feb. 14 with a series of social media posts.

“My heart broke on Valentines Day. Literally,” he tweeted. “I am currently doing well although if I dropped dead you would see a funeral like al Capone!”

“I guess this heart attack has really made me reflect,” he added. “You know, we aren’t guaranteed tomorrow, or u really think about it.”

A rep for Quinn tells PEOPLE the actor is “doing great.” On Monday, he continued to crack jokes about his health emergency as he thanked everyone for all the messages that had been sent his way.

“Thanks for all the kind words and support,” he tweeted. “Starting a list of those who didn’t ‘check in’ yet. Guarantee they’ll regret the day they didn’t wish me well on the road to recovery.”

“A heart attack is a serious thing. When it happens to a celeb let’s double the importance,” he joked. “I understand some people wish me dead, it’s human. I feel that way about plenty of people myself. But there’s ways of doing things. ‘Keep up appearances’ as they say.”

The comedian, who starred in Trainwreck alongside Amy Schumer, also thanked the staff of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City for saving “a great man’s life.”

“They realized they had a precious jewel of comedy in their hands,” he quipped.

Following the health scare, Quinn announced he would be rescheduling a series of planned concerts in Florida.

“My heart goes out to all the people who bought tickets to my show. Literally. My heart went out,” he said in a statement, according to the Tampa Bay Times. “I know you people are still mad that I postponed the show even though I had a heart attack. I felt the same way when I bought Lou Reed tickets last year. I will reschedule once you tell me which weekends are best for you.”",real

""That's a big reason behind all of this — I really feel like there are a lot of misconceptions behind mediums and what we do.

“Deep down we all hoped that people would come to see a film about a fictional country on the continent of Africa, made up of a cast of people of African descent,” the director wrote. “Never in a million years did we imagine that you all would come out this strong.”

He continued, “It still humbles me to think that people care enough to spend their money and time watching our film. But to see people of all backgrounds wearing clothing that celebrates their heritage, taking pictures next to our posters with their friends and family, and sometimes dancing in the lobbies of theaters — often moved me and my wife to tears.”

With its record-obliterating $242 million President’s Day opening weekend and $426 million global launch, “Black Panther” is all but guaranteed to surpass $1 billion at the worldwide box office.

Down the road, “Black Panther” could soon leave several major releases in the dust. A $100 million second weekend is a possible feat for this film, as this weekend’s releases, “Game Night” and “Annihilation,” aren’t expected to open to more than $25 million. At that pace, “Black Panther” could pass the domestic run for “Thor: Ragnarok” as early as this coming Sunday and pass the domestic run for “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” the week after.

Additionally, “Black Panther” is all people have been talking about for weeks. The film holds a score of 96 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and has since received an A+ CinemaScore.

“Black Panther” stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman and Daniel Kaluuya.

“Thank you for giving our team of filmmakers the greatest gift,” he concluded. “The opportunity to share this film, that we poured our hearts and soul into, with you.”

-915084,Jessica Chastain in talks to join sequel to Stephen King's It,"Beverly Marsh’s hair is winter fire, January embers. Jessica Chastain’s heart burns there, too.

Maybe.

The Zero Dark Thirty actress is in talks to join the sequel to Stephen King’s It, playing the adult version of the flame-haired character who inspired that secret admirer’s poem, EW has confirmed.

Ever since New Line announced that King’s epic 1986 novel would be split into two parts, it has been obvious to most people, including director Andy Muschietti, that Chastain would be perfect to play the grown-up Bev, who returns to the town of Derry with her fellow Losers nearly 27 years later to face the evil, shapeless presence they defeated as children.

Chastain previously worked with Muschietti on the 2013 horror film Mama, and during post-production on It, the filmmaker told EW he hoped to recruit her to the Losers’ Club if the sequel became a reality. Now that It stands as the highest grossing horror film of all time, with $700 million in earnings worldwide, things are pretty real.

Variety first reported that Chastain is in talks for the film, which is scheduled for release in September 2019. Bill Skarsgård is also set to return as the malevolent clown — one of It’s favorite forms.

Sophia Lillis played the young Bev Marsh in the original, and she would also return for the sequel, performing new scenes as the character in flashback.

Those who know King’s book are aware that although Beverly survived her first encounter with Pennywise, and her abusive father, she carries with her deep, invisible wounds that have led her to another toxic relationship.

All of the Losers will have traumas that linger from their youth in Derry, and the resurrection of Pennywise serves as the catalyst for dealing with the more mundane monsters who plague them in adulthood.

Muschietti talked about some of what to expect from Chapter 2 in this EW interview after the debut of It.",real

Williams slammed Fergie after the 47-year-old singer’s rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” fell flat with viewers during Sunday night’s NBA All-Star game. Though she said Fergie was “the best,” Williams said the singer “needs auto-tune.”

""There are only a few people who can sing raw... and Fergie is not one,"" Williams said during her show. ""She needs auto-tune. Jen Lopez needs auto-tune. Janet [Jackson] needs auto-tune. Beyoncé needs auto-tune.""

Fergie said she was sorry for the panned performance.

“I've always been honored and proud to perform the national anthem and last night I wanted to try something special for the NBA. I'm a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn't strike the intended tone. I love this country and honestly tried my best,” the Black Eyed Peas singer told TMZ.

Williams said she felt that Fergie “didn’t need to apologize” and the backlash over the performance would simmer down by next week.

“Wow. I don’t really know where to get started on this ‘Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold’ controversy,” she wrote. “This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended. That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I’m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for five minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.”

An article in Jezebel had the headline, Please Give Jennifer Lawrence a Dang Coat, showing the actor’s co-stars, Joel Edgerton and Jeremy Irons among them, wearing large coats and scarves.

“This is sexist, this is ridiculous, this is not feminism,” she wrote. “Overreacting about everything someone says or does, creating controversy over silly innocuous things such as what I choose to wear or not wear, is not moving us forward.

-915293,‘Roseanne’ revival hits a nerve by tapping the political divide,"Eric Deggans:

Well, I do think what's interesting to me about this show is that it didn't really explore the roots of why somebody like Roseanne Conner, who, when we last saw her, you know, was supporting abortion rights, supported gay rights, trying to investigate on her own whether she and her husband had unwittingly transmitted racist views to their son, when he didn't want to kiss a black girl in a school pageant, how somebody like that came to believe that voting for Donald Trump was something that made sense, when Hillary Clinton seemed to be much more in line with those values.

And I don't think the show really investigated that. And that felt like a lost opportunity. When the show was at its height, they spent two episodes looking at how all the characters on that show felt about abortion.

The episodes that I talked about with D.J., Roseanne's son, and racism, they spent a whole episode exploring how he might have come to feel that way and how Roseanne and Dan may have unwittingly contributed to that.

The discuss that we saw in this new ""Roseanne"" was basically a series of sort of jabs and insults traded between two characters. They didn't take a lot of time to sort of investigate how Roseanne may have come to feel the way she felt or how other people in her family may have felt about it. A lot of it was implied.

And I noticed when I tried to talk to the cast about this, when I tried to talk to Roseanne about this back in January, that they were a little hesitant to talk about the political implications of what they were doing and why they were making the choices that they were making to make Roseanne a Trump supporter in the first place.",real
