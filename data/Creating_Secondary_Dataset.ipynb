News has learned exclusively.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, it was revealed that the 39-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and her 25-year-old model beau called it quits after almost two years together.\\n\\n\\\"Scott is very happy Kourtney cut it off with Younes. Although he is happy in his relationship with Sofia, he never liked Younes for Kourtney,\\\" a source told E! News exclusively on Wednesday.\\n\\nScott, 35, and model Sofia Richie, 19, went public with their romance in September. It is his longest relationship since his breakup with Kourtney three years ago.\\n\\n\\\"Scott and Kourtney are in a cordial place right now. Scott is always resistant to rock the boat with Kourtney,\\\" the source said. \\\"He truly will always care about her as wants her to be happy. Everything is always better for the kids' sake, when they are in a good place.\\\"\\n\\nKourtney and Scott, who share three children, were together for nine years before they split in July 2015. Kourtney and Younes started dating in late 2016. Their relationship was Kourtney's longest since her breakup from Scott.\\n\\n\\\"In the beginning, Scott was making fun of Kourtney for dating someone so young and saying it would never last,\\\" another source told E! News. \\\"Once he got with Sofia, he couldn't say anything about Younes. It gave him a lot of perspective and understanding that age is just a number. It was hard for him to see Kourtney dating and he was looking for any reason to not like Younes. But since being with Sofia, he has moved on. Scott cares a lot less than he used to. Of course, Kourtney has a very special place in his heart and always will. He wants Kourtney to be happy.\\\"\",\n          \"There have been a number of rumors over the years about Tom Cruise\\u2019s love life. The Mission Impossible star has kept sort of a low profile with his relationships after splitting from his ex-wife, Katie Holmes, in 2012. Therefore, because he isn\\u2019t jumping on couches and declaring his love for anyone, some tabloids have decided to make up stories about him being romantically involved with other Hollywood A-listers.\\n\\nNow, it\\u2019s time to separate fact from fiction and bust those rumors about who Cruise has dated.\\n\\nAngelina Jolie\\n\\nIn March 2017, the National Enquirer published a bogus report that the actor was dating Angelina Jolie.\\n\\nThe publication claimed that the two stars met to talk about the film they were working on together, however, we know that they never did a movie together so that part isn\\u2019t true. The outlet went on to claim that Jolie was enjoying making her ex, Brad Pitt, jealous about the romance. But Gossip Cop reported that there\\u2019s no truth to that, which makes sense since Jolie told People that dating is the furthest thing from her mind and something she doesn\\u2019t plan on doing for a long time.\\n\\nJane Fonda\\n\\nAfter appearing together at Comic-Con in Las Vegas in spring 2018 to promote their movies, the site New Idea falsely reported that Cruise was seeing Jane Fonda.\\n\\nThe Book Club star ended up debunking this rumor herself during an interview with Extra when she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m not dating anymore, but I did up until a couple of years ago \\u2026 I\\u2019ve closed up shop down there!\\u201d\\n\\nVanessa Kirby\\n\\nThere were wild reports, which surfaced in October 2017, that The Crown actress Vanessa Kirby was marrying, yes marrying, her Mission Impossible \\u2014 Fallout co-star.\\n\\nThe story was published by not one, but two tabloids and totally caught Kirby by surprise. \\u201cThe most disconcerting thing was the people I didn\\u2019t think would believe it did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, \\u2018Are you OK?'\\u201d she told Marie Claire. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think they believe anything they read now because you just can\\u2019t. None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog\\u2014it was marriage.\\u201d\\n\\nElisabeth Moss\\n\\nIn November 2017, another article from the National Enquirer was debunked after it claimed that Cruise was romancing Elisabeth Moss. There was no evidence whatsoever to support this story and it may only have come out because the two Scientologists were both single at the time.\\n\\nMoss though made it clear that to Marie Claire that the report was false and said she has \\u201cno time for dating,\\u201d adding, \\u201cIt\\u2019s actually a problem. But I\\u2019m very focused on my work.\\u201d\\n\\nKatie Holmes\\n\\nFinally, in November 2016, the website called Headlines & Global News did a story that Cruise\\u2019s former wife had dumped her beau, Jamie Foxx, to get back together with him.\\n\\nOf course, time has proven that to be untrue and despite not wanting to talk about their relationship Holmes and Foxx are still going strong. Whenever split rumors do make the rounds, they just leave it to their reps to deny.\",\n          \"*\\n\\nPlease note that this form cannot be used to reset your Googleor Facebook password.

The ex-\\\"SportsCenter\\\" host and her former company both confirmed the news on Aug. 15.\\n\\nBrian To/Shutterstock\\n\\n\\\"Life update. Having successfully settled my case with ESPN/Disney, I have decided to leave so I can exercise my first amendment rights more freely. I am grateful for so many wonderful experiences over the past 16 years and am excited for my next chapter!\\\" she shared on social media.\\n\\nIn a statement, ESPN said the company and Sage \\\"mutually agreed to part ways,\\\" adding, \\\"We thank her for her many contributions over the years.\\\"\\n\\nThe announcement comes after Sage settled a lawsuit with the company that she filed in 2022. In that suit, she claimed ESPN violated her First Amendment rights as well as Connecticut free-speech laws when she was suspended over public comments she made about the network's COVID vaccine policy and former President Barack Obama's racial identity.\\n\\nIt all began when Sage was a guest on a September 2021 episode of the \\\"Uncut With Jay Cutler\\\" podcast. She said she'd just been vaccinated against the coronavirus but called ESPN and parent company The Walt Disney Co.'s corporate vaccine mandate \\\"sick\\\" and \\\"scary to me in many ways.\\\"\\n\\nShe also shared on the podcast that she felt late TV journalist Barbara Walters had belittled her for identifying as biracial. (Sage's father is Gary Steele, the first Black football player at U.S. Military Academy West Point, and mother is Mona Steele, who is white.)\\n\\nSage said that after the founder of \\\"The View\\\" asked her what race she'd choose on the census and she responded, \\\"well, both,\\\" Barbara made a comment about Barack choosing Black. \\\"And I'm like, well, congratulations to the president,\\\" Sage said on the podcast. \\\"That's his thing. I think that's fascinating considering his Black dad was nowhere to be found but his white mom and grandma raised him. But hey, you do you. I'm going to do me.\\\"\\n\\nLogan Riely/Getty Images\\n\\nIn the wake of her podcast comments, ESPN took her off the air for 10 days and pulled her from several big assignments at the network. \\\"At ESPN, we embrace different points of view \\u2014 dialogue and discussion makes this place great,\\\" the company said in a statement. \\\"That said, we expect that those points of view be expressed respectfully, in a manner consistent with our values, and in line with our internal policies.\\\"\\n\\nSage issued an apology, saying in a statement, \\\"I know my recent comments created controversy for the company, and I apologize. We are in the midst of an extremely challenging time that impacts all of us, and it's more critical than ever that we communicate constructively and thoughtfully.\\\"\\n\\nIn her lawsuit, which was filed in 2022, her lawyers accused ESPN of relying \\\"on the misleading characterizations of her comments\\\" and said her employer \\\"forced her to apologize, allowed media to destroy her, and let media reports that she had been suspended go unchallenged, and allowed Steele's colleagues to defame her in violation of company policy without so much as a reprimand.\\\"\\n\\nThe Associated Press reported that in June 2023, court documents showed that ESPN offered to settle Sage's claims for $501,000.00 plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Details on their settlement terms, however, were not made public when Sage and the company announced they'd parted ways in August.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"paraphrased\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 259,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"selena gomez and justin bieber's rumored pregnancy has sparked excitement among fans, with a recent video showing the songstress dodging questions about the matter. according to an australian publication, an insider claimed that during the couple's recent tropical vacation, selena shared some big news with justin, which left him \\\"ecstatic.\\\" however, the report remains unconfirmed, and selena remained tight-lipped when approached by paparazzi.\\n\\nwhile the speculation continues to swirl, it is worth noting that selena is known to be cautious when it comes to contraception, and the couple has reportedly been putting their faith in god's hands. this desire to start a family is not new, with selena having expressed her fondness for being a young mother, and justin eager to settle down.\\n\\ndespite the unverified nature of the rumor, the video of selena's encounter with paparazzi has sparked further interest and speculation. while it remains to be seen if justin or selena will address the matter, fans are left to ponder the possibility of a future together. do you hope for a child between justin and selena? share your thoughts in the comments section below.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
